"Former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Trump critic, and anti-Brexit campaign \u201cscaremonger-general\u201d George Osborne is being lined up as the next chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), according to reports.\n\nThe former Tory MP, whose position in former prime minister David Cameron\u2019s administration was roughly equivalent to that of Secretary of the Treasury in the U.S., would be in line for an increased salary of \u00a3160,000 for the \u201c3-4 days per week\u201d role, with a source telling The Telegraph that government ministers may further increase this to up to \u00a3280,000 to get him to apply.\n\nWhile the right-leaning newspaper reports that Boris Johnson is \u201cunderstood to be very keen to appoint a Conservative to the role to counter a perceived left-wing bias at the corporation\u201d, Osborne would hardly be a disruptive fit at the publicly-funded establishment broadcaster, having been one of the most strident, doom-mongering members of the anti-Brexit campaign during the EU referendum and sneeringly dismissive of the broader national populist movement as embodied by its global standard-bearer, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cFrankly, Trump\u2019s comments fly in the face of the founding principle of the United States,\u201d Osborne had told Parliament in his British government role in 2015, after the then-candidate had said that there are \u201cplaces in London and other places that are so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives.\u201d\n\nDenying that such no-go zones existed \u2014 contrary to the firsthand accounts of frontline officers, who agreed with Trump \u2014 Osborne insisted that London police have \u201cfantastic relations with British Muslims\u201d and that \u201cthe best way to defeat nonsense like this is to engage in robust democratic debate and make it very clear that [Trump\u2019s] views are not welcome.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to tacitly endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential run in May 2016, telling television presenter Robert Peston: \u201cWe look forward to working with whoever the next President is, whoever she may be.\u201d\n\nThis would be completely and utterly insane, the actions of a tone deaf government, I don\u2019t believe it for a second. https://t.co/n0hAPRjJyG \u2014 Darren Grimes (@darrengrimes_) October 16, 2020\n\nOsborne was of course disabused of his belief that Clinton was a shoo-in for the presidency later that year \u2014 although not before another upset victory for anti-establishment forces terminated his political career with the vote to Leave the European Union.\n\nLeave campaigners have expressed incredulity that the man who was arguably at the apex of the Remain campaign\u2019s infamous Project Fear, issuing now disproven threats of 500,000 to over 800,000 job losses in the immediate aftermath of a Brexit vote, along with a savage \u201cpunishment budget\u201d \u2014 which he was not around to implement, as it turned out \u2014 could possibly be considered for BBC chairman by Boris Johnson\u2019s pro-Brexit administration.\n\n\u201cThis would be completely and utterly insane, the actions of a tone-deaf government,\u201d commented Brexit campaigner Darren Grimes on the news. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it for a second.\u201d\n\nJohnson has, however, pushed his former Bullingdon Club frenemy for prominent quasi-political positions before, reportedly lobbying President Trump \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to back Osborne for International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director in 2019.\n\nThe former Chancellor, for his part, has displayed a voracious appetite for part-time, highly-paid roles since exiting the political arena, being reported to have netted as many as nine jobs in late 2018, including the editorship of the Russian-owned London Evening Standard \u2014 controversial among journalists, given he has essentially zero previous experience \u2014 and position at the BlackRock investment corporation which paid a reported \u00a3650,000 a year for a one-day work week.\n\nThe Telegraph said that some sources downplayed Osborne\u2019s chances of getting the BBC chairmanship if he is persuaded to apply, however, and that other likely, high-profile applicants include Remain-supporting former Tory MP Nicky Morgan, Theresa May\u2019s former communications director Sir Robbie Gibb, and former Equality and Human Rights Commission chairman Trevor Phillips.\n\nOsborne declined to comment on his intentions when the newspaper approached him.\n\nDoubtless Osborne will do for the BBC what he\u2019s done for the Standard.

She became involved in far-left circles, advocating for black nationalism and eventually becoming an elected member of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA. She served four stints in prison during her time as a far-left activist in America.\n\nJones was an early proponent of what was later termed \u2018intersectionality\u2019, writing in 1949: \u201cThe bourgeoisie is fearful of the militancy of the Negro woman, and for good reason. The capitalists know, far better than many progressives seem to know, that once Negro women begin to take action, the militancy of the whole Negro people, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition, is greatly enhanced.\u201d\n\nGoogle said in a statement: \u201cThroughout her life, Jones tirelessly championed issues like civil rights, gender equality, and decolonisation through journalism, community organisation, and public speaking. She focused much of her work on the liberation of Black women everywhere from the discrimination they faced due to a combination of classism, racism, and sexism.\u201d\n\nThe Silicon Valley tech company thanked Ms Jones for her \u201clifelong commitment to a more equitable world\u201d.\n\nIn 1955, Jones was deported to the UK for being a foreign-born member of the Communist Party. Upon reaching the UK, she founded the country\u2019s first black-owned newspaper, the West Indian Gazette, which folded after eight months after her death due to lack of funding.\n\nFollowing the Notting Hill Race Riots, she held a \u2018mardi gras\u2019 in London in 1959, with the proceeds going to pay for the fines and legal costs of the rioters. The street party she put on is seen as a precursor to the Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nClaudia Jones died in 1964 at the age of 49. She is buried to the left of her hero, Communist Manifesto author Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetary in London.\n\nIt's a shame @GoogleUK didn't take the opportunity yesterday to celebrate the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. pic.twitter.com/7SqkoyM868 \u2014 Calvin Robinson (@calvinrobinson) October 14, 2020\n\nIn response to the decision by Google to celebrate Claudia Jones, mixed-race political commentator Calvin Robinson told Breitbart London: \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that Google chose to celebrate the life of a black nationalist communist while having the motto \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know the evils of communism, and the millions of lives lost to this ideology,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nHe said that Google and other left-leaning companies have \u201cjumped on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon, seemingly without looking into their core values. Either that or Google also subscribe to a neo-Marxist ideology, which I hope is not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cBLM is dangerous, and it\u2019s unwise for Google to be taking this approach. I don\u2019t want my search engine lecturing me on any political stance \u2014 but if they must, I\u2019d rather they maintain some semblance of balance,\u201d Mr Robinson said.\n\n\u201cIt was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birthday the day before. The first female Prime Minister. I didn\u2019t see Google celebrating her!\u201d he pointed out.\n\nMr Robinson also criticised the concept of Black History Month \u2014 which is celebrated in the UK in October \u2014 saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary and it\u2019s divisive. We teach history based on events that shaped our nation, not based on the colour of our skin.\u201d\n\nRobinson also rejected the notion of the \u201cblack community\u201d, pronouncing: \u201cI\u2019m a member of the British community, the Christian community, my local community, but the colour of my skin doesn\u2019t determine much about me, nor should it.\u201d\n\nExclusive: \u2018If We Go Off-Script We\u2019re Race-Traitors\u2019 \u2013 Black Educator Mobbed After Criticising BLM, Critical Race Theory https://t.co/YnOiTxwK8x \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 16, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulkaFREE now and never miss the top politics stories again.

Well, we won\u2019t have to wait long as Michel Barnier will be on the Eurostar to London next week for a further round of intensive negotiations. At the heart of the problem is the Prime Minister\u2019s insistence that Britain seeks a Canada-style free trade deal. He says this is what we wanted all along. Sadly, this is not the case as the oven-ready deal (so widely applauded at the time) was in fact an EU treaty which delighted Monsieur Barnier and his gang in Brussels.

But we have been here before many times, when tough words from both sides of this negotiation lead in the end to a compromise. I still believe that the most likely outcome will be a deal based on the withdrawal agreement with both sides claiming victory and insisting that their red lines have been maintained.

These sorts of biases are extremely difficult to measure and certainly are not reflected in the ONS data.\u201d\n\nWhy so-called \u201cunconscious biases\u201d against minorities would hold down people of African or Pakistani origin but allow people of Chinese or Indian origin to rise above the native population was not explained.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore the historical iniquity faced by minority communities,\u201d Begum insisted \u2014 apparently failing to consider any reasons why one ethnic group might have somewhat poorer average economic outcomes than another besides some form of repression by society at large.\n\nWATCH: BBC Pushes \u2018White Privilege\u2019 Through Bitesize School Education Service https://t.co/5iYmMtJhnX \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 5, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomeryThe prevalence of leftist concepts such as \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d in British society further disadvantages white working-class boys, a professor has told a Parliamentary committee.\n\nIn a meeting of the House of Commons Education Select Committee, Professor Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist from the University of Kent, said that white working-class boys face a \u201cstatus deficit\u201d as the national conversation typically focusses on \u201chistoric grievances\u201d and other issues facing black and other minority groups.\n\n\u201cWe have inadvertently legitimised a view within some communities that they are not treated with the same status, respect and recognition as others,\u201d Goodwin said, according to The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cMy fear now with the onset of new terms \u2014 toxic masculinity, white privilege \u2014 this will become even more of a problem as we send a signal to these communities that they are the problem, it is not the system more generally that has let them down, they are the problem and they should make amends for simply being who they are,\u201d he told MPs.\n\nResearch submitted to the committee in September found that working-class white students are 50 per cent less likely than minority groups to achieve strong passes on the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) tests used by universities to determine a student\u2019s academic aptitude.\n\nWhite students are also the least likely to enter for GSCE subjects that have traditionally counted towards the English Baccalaureate award, with just 37.5 white pupils entering for the award, the lowest of any ethnic group in the country.\n\nWATCH: BBC Pushes \u2018White Privilege\u2019 Through Bitesize School Education Service https://t.co/5iYmMtJhnX \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 5, 2020\n\nAs to why working-class white students are fairing worse than their minority counterparts, Professor Goodwin suggested that \u201ccultural\u201d factors are likely to blame, explaining that it has become \u201ctaboo\u201d in British society to discuss issues facing poor white boys.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart London, mixed-race educator and political and social commentator Calvin Robinson confirmed the disparity. Mr Robinson said: \u201cI saw first hand that black children of African descent excel throughout their time in school, and are far more likely to go to university.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the flip side of that coin, working-class white boys are the most disadvantaged and very few people seem brave enough to address the problem. The evidence suggests that if the UK is racist, it\u2019s not in the way the hard-left would accept,\u201d he explained.\n\nEmeritus professor of education at Cambridge University, Prof Diane Reay, warned the committee that she fears the lack of national attention given to poorer white communities is resulting in anger and division within society.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s growing levels of social resentment and a sense of being left behind among white working classes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cResearch shows us very high levels of polarisation particularly between highly credentialed groups, those of us with degrees, and those people who leave school with very few qualifications,\u201d Prof Reay added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of understanding and empathy for the class \u2018other\u2019 among all class groups, but I think that it has the most power to injure and to have a detrimental effect on those with the least power in society, those who see themselves as educational failures and losers,\u201d she concluded.\n\nRacism: Top UK Schools Reject Scholarship Funding for Poor White Boys https://t.co/GXrdMHgAL1 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 1, 2020\n\nThe inquiry was established in April by the chairman of the Commons Select Committee for Education, Robert Halfon, in order to study the reasons for some ethnic groups falling behind in society, such as the Roma and the white working-class.\n\nConfirming Prof Goodwin\u2019s assertion that it is \u201ctaboo\u201d to discuss the issues facing white boys, the Conservative MP for Harlow said that by merely establishing the inquiry, he was accused of being racist.\n\n\u201cThe whole premise of the committee is to look at left behind cohorts, those who are falling way behind,\u201d Halfon explained, adding: \u201cOne of those groups sadly is white working-class pupils from [a] poor background, and within that group, boys do worse than girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been accused of racism, which I find really hard to fathom. Other ethnic groups are outperforming white, so I can\u2019t see why this is racist,\u201d Halfon said.\n\n'White Privilege'? Working-Class White Kids MOST Disadvantaged in UK Schools as System Prioritises Minorities https://t.co/94S0uEmAyt \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 20, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulkaMuslim prison gangs are forcing inmates to convert to Islam and follow religious practices or face violent repercussions, according to a government report.\n\nThe report, carried out by the Ministry of Justice, surveyed 83 male prisoners and 73 staff at three of the eight high-security prisons in the country. It found that large gangs of Muslim men were using intimidation tactics to force conversions and rules on other prisoners. The gangs were made up of multiple ranks including leadership, foot soldiers, recruiters, and enforcers.\n\nThose who had committed terrorist activities were said to hold key positions of influence among the gangs, as well as those who can speak Arabic and recite the Quran.\n\nIt was said that the gangs were establishing Islamic rules within the prisons such as underwear having to be worn in the showers and banning the cooking of bacon.\n\nUK Gets First Muslim Majority Prison, Controlled By \u2018Islamic Protection Racket\u2019 http://t.co/mS4n0Zu243 pic.twitter.com/9k3v1W0qmK \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2015\n\nThe report highlighted the fact that Muslim gangs were the only serious organised gang threat within the prisons surveyed and that as a result, they wielded considerable influence and power over their fellow inmates.\n\nOne non-Muslim prisoner said: \u201cThere is an underlying pressure for people to convert and join the gang. The tactic they use is to befriend someone when they come in. If they don\u2019t convert they will then start spreading rumours about them, that the person is a snitch so that they will be ostracised. Then the beatings will follow.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Muslim prisoner spoke of the pressure on other inmates to convert, saying that they could not even escape by moving prisons. \u201cThey know they\u2019re only going to three other jails and they know there will be brothers waiting there to stab them,\u201d the prisoner said.\n\nThe study echoes a report from The Sun from 2016 which alleged that at one prison, HMP Gartree in Leicestershire, Muslim prisoners had turned sections of the prison into \u2018no-go zones\u2019 for non-Muslim inmates, even imposing sharia law.\n\nOne source said at the time: \u201cIt is so bad non-Muslim prisoners are refusing to move there as they feel intimidated. There is huge pressure put on them to convert and a threat of violence if they don\u2019t. The Muslim gangs have their own rules and use Sharia law to sort out disagreements. In effect, they are setting up their own prison within a prison. There have been stories about non-Muslim inmates being barred from putting up topless pictures of women in their cells and even showering naked.\u201d\n\n\u2018Prisoners Forced to Convert to Islam for Protection\u2019 Claims Christian Pastor https://t.co/qWhIHxoL9S \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2018\n\nIn 2018, the Ministry of Justice reportedly blocked an independent three-year report from being carried out into the impact of Islamic gangs in UK prisons because of fears of the results. One source said: \u201cThe corporate culture of the service is defensive and they will have been concerned about what this proposed project will discover.\u201d\n\nLast year, a Christian pastor who worked as a prison chaplain also claimed that prisoners were being coerced into converting to Islam in exchange for protection from gangs. Pastor Paul Song said of the culture in Brixton prison: \u201cIf someone is secular and in prison and they want to lead a peaceful life in prison they need to become Muslim. That way they are protected.\u201d"
