"A police officer who almost died after being poisoned in the Salisbury novichok attack in 2018 has announced he is quitting the force because he can \u201cno longer do the job\u201d.\n\nDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey said he was leaving Wiltshire Police after 18 years because he now knew he would \u201cnot find peace\u201d while remaining an officer.\n\nAt the end of a statement on Twitter, he used the hashtag #MentalHealthMatters.\n\n\u201cAfter 18 years in the Police Force I\u2019ve had to admit defeat and accept that I can no longer do the job,\u201d the statement read. \u201cI wanted to be a Police Officer since I was a teenager, I couldn't envisage doing anything else, which is why this makes me so sad.\n\n\u201cLike most Police Officers, I\u2019ve experienced my fair share of trauma, violence, upset, injury and grief. We deal with it, take it on the chin and keep going because that\u2019s our job. But we\u2019re still human and the impact this has shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe events in Salisbury in March 2018 took so much from me and although I\u2019ve tried so hard to make it work, I know that I won\u2019t find peace whilst remaining in that environment. Policing will remain in my heart and I feel honoured and privileged to have been part of Wiltshire Police.\u201d\n\nMr Bailey was the first investigator to enter Sergei Skripal\u2019s home after the former double agent and his daughter fell ill in March 2018.\n\nMr Bailey and other officers did not know at the time that novichok had been used, but later found the nerve agent had been smeared on a door handle.\n\nHe spent two weeks in intensive care following his poisoning, during which time his wife and two daughters feared he would die. After being discharged from hospital, Mr Bailey said he and his family had endured an \u201cemotional battering\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot only did we lose the house, we lost all of our possessions, including everything the kids owned, we lost all that, the cars,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe lost everything. And yeah it\u2019s been very difficult to kind of come to terms with that.\u201d\n\nMr Bailey made a third attempt to go back to work in June this year, describing how he \u201ccouldn\u2019t deal with being in a police environment\u201d, after efforts to return in September 2018 and in January 2019.\n\nThe Skripals survived but the incident later claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess after she came into contact with a perfume bottle believed to have been used in the attack and then discarded.\n\nHer partner, Charlie Rowley, was left seriously ill but recovered.\n\nTwo Russian nationals have been accused of travelling to the UK to try to murder Mr Skripal with novichok.\n\nThe suspects \u2013 known by aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov \u2013 were caught on CCTV in Salisbury the day before the attack.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied any involvement, with President Vladimir Putin claiming the two suspects were civilians.Police forces are to be given the personal details of people told to self-isolate by the government\u2019s test-and-trace service in an effort to help officers enforce the quarantine rules.\n\nMinisters have agreed a deal with the National Police Chiefs Council that will allow officers to request on a case-by-case basis information including the name, address and contact details of people who have been told to isolate.\n\nThe move, first reported by the Health Service Journal, was confirmed on Friday night after the Department of Health and Social Care updated its online guidance about how personal information would be handled.\n\nThe HSJ reported the changes have sparked concerns among some senior health officials that the sharing of data with the police could shake confidence in the service and reduce people\u2019s willingness to cooperate, especially among minority communities.\n\nThe DHSC confirmed the deal had been struck with police but emphasised no health data would be shared with police officers. Only people living in England will be affected.\n\nA memorandum of understanding between the DHSC and the National Police Chiefs Council was agreed last weekend amid concerns officers were unable to police the self-isolation rules after a positive coronavirus test without being able to verify whether individuals had been told to self-isolate. Public Health England will share the information with police on a case-by-case basis with officers expected to call a helpline to make requests as needed.\n\nThe HSJ said the office of chief medical officer Chris Whitty had \u201cexpressed significant reservations\u201d about the changes and warned it could discourage people from being tested if they knew police could access their information.\n\nA DHSC source told the HSJ: \u201cThe [CMO\u2019s office] are worried that people will simply stop getting tested because it just opens them up to the risk of being tracked by police and fined, and so the department is creating a strong disincentive to testing, which creates a big public health risk.\u201d\n\nBut a separate government source defended the changes as a \u201cbalanced and pragmatic solution\u201d to a \u201ctricky problem\u201d.\n\nThey argued that making self-isolation legally enforceable was an appropriate \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for the financial support being given to those people by government, and it was right that police had what they needed to ensure people followed the rules.\n\nThe new guidance says anyone who is told to self-isolate by NHS test and trace will be regularly contacted by phone and text. If the service is unable to reach people or they refuse to self-isolate information will be passed to local councils.\n\nThe guidance adds: \u201cIf there is evidence to suggest you are not complying with the duty to self-isolate without reasonable justification, your local authority may pass this information on to local police forces to investigate further. This may lead to enforcement action being taken against you, which could include you being fined.\u201d\n\nThe guidance also states: \u201cA police force may request information relating to positive Covid-19 tests from the NHS Test & Trace programme directly, where they are investigating a report of someone who may not be complying with the mandatory self-isolation period.\u201d\n\nA DHCS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is a legal requirement for people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and their close contacts to self-isolate when formally notified to do so.Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said the decision was based on statements by the presidents of the US, France and Russia, representing the OSCE Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by the three countries to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.The order followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014 and the first chance to vote for many young people and first-time voters. The elections were seen as an opportunity for change after years of military rule.HuffPost is part of Verizon Media.

Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded.\n\n\u201cAn independent review by the government Internal Audit Agency similarly showed the claims made by the Labour Party were false. This was not a policing matter, and we consider this was a waste of police time\u201d.\n\nIPOC director general Michael Lockwood also said in a statement: \u201cThe IOPC completed a thorough, independent and impartial assessment to determine if there were reasonable grounds to suspect the criminal offence of misconduct in public office had occurred.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence to indicate that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of any sponsorship monies to Ms Arcuri or that he influenced or played an active part in securing her participation in trade missions.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cThere was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making.\u201d\u00a9 Photo: UK PARLIAMENT / JESSICA TAYLOR British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nEuropean and British negotiators will be in touch Monday to discuss the \"structure\" of post-Brexit trade talks, despite London's threat on Friday to walk away unless there was a major shift in Brussels' approach.\n\nAn EU spokesman tweeted that chief negotiator Michel Barnier held video talks with his British counterpart David Frost on Friday after the results of European summit provoked an angry response in London.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: UK PARLIAMENT / JESSICA TAYLOR Boris Johnson on Friday kept the door open to more Brexit talks but insisted Britain was ready to slam it shut unless the EU offers \"fundamental change\".

All rights reserved.W HEN JAMES returned from the hospital after the birth of his son, he was surprised to find a bottle of whisky and some cans of lager on his doorstep. The mystery was soon solved. Under covid-19 rules, James was allowed into the hospital where his partner Annie was due to give birth only once active labour had begun. Thirty-six hours after being admitted for an induction, Annie found herself on a delivery ward in the early hours of the morning desperately trying to rouse her sleeping husband by phone. When that failed, she resorted to ordering a delivery from a local off-licence in the hope that the doorbell would prove more effective. In the event, he woke before the booze arrived.\n\nJames made it to the hospital on time and all went well. Others have not been so lucky. \u201cI\u2019ve heard real horror stories of what women have had to face alone, whether it\u2019s awful news at a scan or going through a difficult birth without your partner there,\u201d says Joeli Brearley of Pregnant Then Screwed, a campaign group. As Britain locked down in March, hospitals limited the number of visitors allowed on their premises. Pregnant women had to attend 12- and 20-week scans, and go through much of the process of labour, alone. Non-essential retail reopened in June, followed by pubs and restaurants in July, but tight restrictions have remained in place limiting access to maternity services and post-birth visits by new fathers. A petition calling for the rules to be loosened across Britain has received over 440,000 signatures and the backing of 60 MP s.\n\nThe Royal College of Midwives, a trade union and professional body, acknowledges that \u201cthe support of a partner during scans and labour is important\u201d, but argues that restricting access to some services means that \u201cmaternity teams can continue to deliver good-quality, safe care, protecting pregnant women and the midwives who care for them.\u201d Others are less convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the vast majority of birth partners live with the woman giving birth,\u201d says Jeremy Davies of the Fatherhood Institute, a think-tank. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a sudden spike in virgin conceptions.\u201d Evidence suggests the presence of partners leads to better medical outcomes, partly because it reduces stress and anxiety during birth.\n\nIn response to rising discontent the NHS issued new guidance for maternity services on September 8th. But campaigners say that interpretations of the guidelines vary widely across the country and most services remain closed to partners. The concept of \u201cactive labour\u201d is especially slippery. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this stuff runs on a timetable,\u201d says a midwife. As of late September, fewer than one in four hospital trusts were allowing partners to be present for the whole of labour and half were still banning women from being accompanied to their 12-week scan. As Ms Brearley says, \u201cNo one should have to find out they have miscarried alone.\u201d \u25a0\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.
