She became involved in far-left circles, advocating for black nationalism and eventually becoming an elected member of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA. She served four stints in prison during her time as a far-left activist in America.\n\nJones was an early proponent of what was later termed \u2018intersectionality\u2019, writing in 1949: \u201cThe bourgeoisie is fearful of the militancy of the Negro woman, and for good reason. The capitalists know, far better than many progressives seem to know, that once Negro women begin to take action, the militancy of the whole Negro people, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition, is greatly enhanced.\u201d\n\nGoogle said in a statement: \u201cThroughout her life, Jones tirelessly championed issues like civil rights, gender equality, and decolonisation through journalism, community organisation, and public speaking. She focused much of her work on the liberation of Black women everywhere from the discrimination they faced due to a combination of classism, racism, and sexism.\u201d\n\nThe Silicon Valley tech company thanked Ms Jones for her \u201clifelong commitment to a more equitable world\u201d.\n\nIn 1955, Jones was deported to the UK for being a foreign-born member of the Communist Party. Upon reaching the UK, she founded the country\u2019s first black-owned newspaper, the West Indian Gazette, which folded after eight months after her death due to lack of funding.\n\nFollowing the Notting Hill Race Riots, she held a \u2018mardi gras\u2019 in London in 1959, with the proceeds going to pay for the fines and legal costs of the rioters. The street party she put on is seen as a precursor to the Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nClaudia Jones died in 1964 at the age of 49. She is buried to the left of her hero, Communist Manifesto author Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetary in London.\n\nIt's a shame @GoogleUK didn't take the opportunity yesterday to celebrate the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. pic.twitter.com/7SqkoyM868 \u2014 Calvin Robinson (@calvinrobinson) October 14, 2020\n\nIn response to the decision by Google to celebrate Claudia Jones, mixed-race political commentator Calvin Robinson told Breitbart London: \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that Google chose to celebrate the life of a black nationalist communist while having the motto \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know the evils of communism, and the millions of lives lost to this ideology,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nHe said that Google and other left-leaning companies have \u201cjumped on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon, seemingly without looking into their core values. Either that or Google also subscribe to a neo-Marxist ideology, which I hope is not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cBLM is dangerous, and it\u2019s unwise for Google to be taking this approach. I don\u2019t want my search engine lecturing me on any political stance \u2014 but if they must, I\u2019d rather they maintain some semblance of balance,\u201d Mr Robinson said.\n\n\u201cIt was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birthday the day before. The first female Prime Minister. I didn\u2019t see Google celebrating her!\u201d he pointed out.\n\nMr Robinson also criticised the concept of Black History Month \u2014 which is celebrated in the UK in October \u2014 saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary and it\u2019s divisive. We teach history based on events that shaped our nation, not based on the colour of our skin.\u201d\n\nRobinson also rejected the notion of the \u201cblack community\u201d, pronouncing: \u201cI\u2019m a member of the British community, the Christian community, my local community, but the colour of my skin doesn\u2019t determine much about me, nor should it.\u201d\n\nExclusive: \u2018If We Go Off-Script We\u2019re Race-Traitors\u2019 \u2013 Black Educator Mobbed After Criticising BLM, Critical Race Theory https://t.co/YnOiTxwK8x \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 16, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulkaFREE now and never miss the top politics stories again.

Well, we won\u2019t have to wait long as Michel Barnier will be on the Eurostar to London next week for a further round of intensive negotiations. At the heart of the problem is the Prime Minister\u2019s insistence that Britain seeks a Canada-style free trade deal. He says this is what we wanted all along. Sadly, this is not the case as the oven-ready deal (so widely applauded at the time) was in fact an EU treaty which delighted Monsieur Barnier and his gang in Brussels.

Not that this murder was a surprise \u2013 now we have lived for almost eight years under the permanent threat of terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly shocked because this attack targets a teacher. In the history of the French Republic, teachers symbolise a very special figure. The one who gives you hope for unity and fraternity.\n\n\u201cSometimes we have the feeling that this battle against religious fanaticism is endless but the only secret hope we have is that teachers, with their patience and pedagogy, will be able to block and diffuse hatred and fanaticism in the heart of the next generation by making them understand satirical culture, Charlie Hebdo, and freedom of speech. But yesterday a bit of that hope was beheaded.\u201d\n\nShe argued those who \u201cdare to\u201d defend secularism and freedom of speech in the country are under great strain.\n\nMs Fourest added: \u201cWe cannot win a war because it is an asymmetric war, between reason on one side and madness on the other side. You can be patient and precise. You can explain again and again and again.\u201d\n\nHer comments come after two journalists from a film production firm were stabbed with a meat cleaver outside the old offices of Charlie Hebdo three weeks ago.\n\nAn 18-year-old man from Pakistan who was arrested for the attack told police he was upset Charlie Hebdo had republished caricatures of the prophet of Islam.\n\nFourteen people who are suspected of being involved in the 2015 terror attack on Charlie Hebdo, which took place after the paper published caricatures of the prophet of Islam are currently on trial in Paris \u2013 with the trial set to go on until November.\n\nIn the French National Assembly, the equivalent of parliament, deputies stood up to pay tribute to the teacher.B usinesses asking the government to swoop in and hit them with a new regulatory requirement backed by the force of law? Surely this can\u2019t be true?\n\nIn any other year this would be a laughable idea but in 2020, which has been as weird as it has been woeful, this is the state of play.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that infection rates in Greater Manchester were \"grave\" and added: \"Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die.\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the European Union must accept the \u201creality\u201d than a UK-EU trade deal must be beneficial to the United Kingdom as well as the bloc.\n\nDr Merkel, who currently holds the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union, told a meeting of European mayors on Tuesday that \u201cwe have to prepare for the event that there will be no agreement\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also have to take into account the reality; an agreement has to be in the interests of both parties, in British interests as well as the interests of the 27 member European Union,\u201d the council president said, according to The Telegraph.\n\nThe UK officially left the EU on January 31st, 2020, but remains tied to Brussels rules in a transition period which expires on New Year\u2019s Eve. If a deal is not struck and signed in time for the end of the deadline, the UK will leave the bloc\u2019s institutions and trade with it on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.\n\nSo far, the EU and its negotiator, Michel Barnier, have refused to soften on London\u2019s red lines, such as regaining full control of the UK\u2019s waters, regulations, and laws. Some European leaders have said that they will resist any deal unless current fishing rights are retained, and the UK agrees to restrict itself by abiding by \u2018level playing field\u2019 rules.\n\nHowever, for a deal to be struck, it needs to be mutually beneficial. The UK has already demonstrated that it is capable of signing such deals with third nations, after agreeing in principle early last month a free trade agreement with Japan that is due to be signed next week.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a Political, Free Trade, and Strategic Partnership Agreement between their countries which aims \u201cto strengthen UK cooperation in political, security and foreign matters with Ukraine, while also securing continued preferential trade for businesses and consumers\u201d \u2014 essentially, a continuation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.\n\nUK Drops Boris Johnson\u2019s Thursday Brexit Deadline, Talks Will Continue into November: Report https://t.co/FuKM1T3gNZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 14, 2020\n\nThe German leader\u2019s approach is in stark difference to that of France, which has vowed to show \u201cno weakness\u201d in negotiations, particularly in relation to fishing rights. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, the EU can plunder more than 60 per cent of the fish landed in the UK\u2019s territorial waters, with the French, for example, free to catch more than 90 per cent of English Channel cod.\n\nHowever, Mrs Merkel\u2019s tone also conflicts with statements just from Tuesday from Germany\u2019s own Europe minister. Michael Roth said that EU members \u201cexpect substantial progress by our friends in the United Kingdom in key areas: in particular on governance, \u2018level playing field\u2019 and fisheries\u201d \u2014 suggesting it should be Britain making all the compromises, not the EU.\n\nMr Roth has been clear that the EU should prepare for the UK\u2019s WTO exit. Likewise, Mrs Merkel has been consistent since the summer that both her country and the EU should prepare for the possibility of a no-deal scenario.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Johnson had made Thursday the deadline for either agreeing on a deal or deciding to walk away from negotiations and preparing for WTO, reports circulated on Wednesday that the prime minister was already preparing to extend that internal deadline further, after already reneging on a similar deadline he had set for June.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Barnier expressed what may be a generally felt assumption in Europe \u2014 that Johnson does not stick by his deadlines and may be a soft touch \u2014 saying: \u201cIt is the third unilateral deadline that Johnson has imposed without agreement\u2026 We still have time.\u201d\n\nOne government source told The Times that Brussels is using the \u201cold playbook\u201d of \u201crunning down the clock\u201d to put pressure on the UK.\n\nThe Telegraph reports, however, that Mr Johnson told ministers he still believes a deal can be struck by tomorrow, but said that there should be \u201cno fear\u201d over a no-deal Brexit.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tied Britain\u2019s post-Brexit success to the re-election of President Donald Trump, warning that should 77-year-old Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden prevail then the hopes of a British-American free trade deal would be dashed.\n\nThe long-time Trump ally said that the 2020 election is feeling like \u201c2016 all over again\u201d, pointing to polls produced by CNN and \u201cother anti-Trump media outlets\u201d showing a lead for the former vice president.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Express, Mr Farage referenced a poll conducted by the same British paper which saw the President leading in battleground states as an indicator that \u201conce again\u201d the mainstream media has got it wrong, quipping: \u201cYou might even call it Fake News.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in 2016, I stuck my neck out and not only backed the Trump campaign but also predicted he would win. This was treated [with] much hilarity at the time from the great and the good.

In the column, Mr Johnson said that the move by Obama to remove the bust of Sir Winston Churchill from the Oval Office was seen by some as a \u201csnub to Britain\u201d and a \u201csymbol of the part-Kenyan President\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British Empire.\u201d\n\nA British diplomat said: \u201cThey remember that. Democrats also regard Trump as appalling and disgusting and there will be a penalty for people who sucked up to Trump. Angela Merkel didn\u2019t. Macron did and then got tough. The Democrats don\u2019t much like Brexit.\u201d\n\nOther diplomats in America have sent back telegrams to the United Kingdom warning that a Biden administration would seek to secure a revival of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a deal with the EU rather than a bilateral agreement with Britain.\n\nMr Biden suggested in September that if the United Kingdom does not submit to European control over Northern Ireland then the U.S. would punish Britain, saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.\u201d\n\nBoris Suggest Anti-Brexit Biden Does Not Understand EU Talks https://t.co/fYpLrxs1NL \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 18, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulkaFormer British deputy prime minister of turned Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, was allegedly involved in the tech giant\u2019s decision to censor the New York Post article exposing details about the Biden family.\n\nA report in The Telegraph claims that the anti-Trump British politician \u2014 who exited the former Conservative-Liberal Democrat government when the latter was trounced in the 2015 elections \u2014 was one of several members of the content moderation team who decided to reduce the distribution of the damaging report their site.\n\nWhile most censorship decisions on Facebook are handled by low-level employees and algorithms, high-profile cases such as the New York Post story are said to be handled by Facebook\u2019s vice president of content policy, then the vice president of global public policy, and, finally, by the former Lib Dem leader.\n\nA select few cases, including posts from President Donald Trump, are reportedly adjudicated by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, although the former deputy prime minister is also said to be in on such top decisions.\n\nSir Nick became Deputy Prime Minister in 2010 after forming a coalition government with the Conservative Party, then led by the notionally centre-right David Cameron.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Lib Dems saw a drastic decrease in support from the public, winning just 8 seats in the 2015 general election, a defeat which led to Sir Nick being ousted as leader of the party.

In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform.\u201d\n\nNewly obtained emails from a Hunter Biden business partner lay out in detail how the Vice President\u2019s son used access to the Obama administration to arrange meetings for potential foreign clients and investors at the highest levels in the White House. https://t.co/OYbs74fhjV \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 16, 2020\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump suggested that \u201cBig Tech\u201d was censoring the story in order to help Joe Biden win the election in November.\n\n\u201cNow Big Tech, you see what is going on with Big Tech, [it] is censoring these stories to try and get Joe Biden out of this impossible jam,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s in a big jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe and his family are crooked and they got caught and now they\u2019re being protected by Big Tech,\u201d Trump added.\n\nRepublican Senator Josh Hawley \u2014 who has asked both Facebook and Twitter to testify before Congress over the alleged election interference \u2014 said: \u201cIt\u2019s basically Big Tech versus democracy. These tech companies want to control what we read. They want to control journalists in this country. They want to control the news and we just can\u2019t let them.\u201d\n\nNever before have we seen tech platforms so blatantly play defense for a political campaign as today.

Boris now reaching the right solution.\u201d\n\nOther messages of support for the prime minister from Berxiteers poured in, including from veteran eurosceptic and Conservative MP John Redwood who said: \u201cWell said Prime Minister. We should now leave without giving away our laws and our fish. He is right the EU has not negotiated seriously, so it is best to leave and trade under World trade rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UK will prosper more with no deal than with a bad deal,\u201d Mr Redwood added.\n\nWhile Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkins tweeted: \u201c#LetsGoWTO!

Close file, move on with confidence. No deal is always better than a bad deal,\u201d Mr Tice said.\n\nFellow former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib also agreed that Mr Johnson should have announced the closure of talks, saying: \u201cNow he needs the courage to rip up the WA [withdrawal agreement] and cease negotiations with the EU. Only then can we be free of them.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator was scheduled to travel to London on Monday for further talks; however, Number 10 reportedly said that talks are \u201cover\u201d and there is \u201cno point\u201d to Mr Barnier making the journey unless the EU is prepared to change its negotiating position.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart London, Ben Harris-Quinney, the chairman of the UK\u2019s oldest conservative think tank The Bow Group, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that Boris\u2019s deal isn\u2019t much different to May\u2019s. I\u2019m often critical of Boris, and certainly the Conservative Party\u2019s handling of Brexit, but credit has to be given that he seems to have at least learned the lesson that May didn\u2019t. Brexiteers expect a full Brexit, not a halfway house, and if that isn\u2019t on the table for a deal, then no deal is the ONLY option.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad that Boris has shown far greater metal than his predecessors to stick to his guns, he must not budge an inch, and on this point, all conservatives should support him,\u201d the Bow Group chairman added.\n\nFarage Warns Boris\u2019s Brexit Deal Will Leave UK Liable to EU Bank https://t.co/yGgrEYJ4Xi \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 12, 2020\n\nNegotiations appeared to have stalled broadly over the issue of continued fishing rights in British waters, with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron saying on Thursday that unless the UK conceded on fishing, it should prepare for no deal.\n\nMr Harris-Quinney remarked on the importance of the fishing industry, telling this publication: \u201cWhilst fisheries are now a relatively small part of our economy, that is because of the decimating effect the EU has had on them over many decades.\n\n\u201cEven if the difference between the two sides comes down to the insistence of the EU to continue to fish in British territory, then our response must be the same as it would be to any other nation expecting to plunder our resources: bugger off.\u201dA CLERIC claims we are heading for a \u201ctragedy of \u00adhistoric proportions\u201d if Brits do not start returning to church.\n\nParish churches averaged just four funerals, one wedding and three christenings last year.\n\n2 Congregation at St Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol, UK Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nFor centuries they were focal points for towns and villages, but Rev Marcus Walker, of Great St Bart\u2019s in the City of London, says they could soon disappear. Mr Walker told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cIf we can\u2019t convince a new generation of the reality and love of God, then all this will come to an end and it will be a tragedy of \u00adhistoric proportions for our nation.\u201d\n\nLast year, medium-sized institutions attracted no more than 26 \u00adworshippers on an average Sunday. Congregations have halved since 1970.\n\nIn England, fewer than fewer than 700,000 people now attend Sunday services.\n\nMany churches have moved in whole or in part online as a result of the pandemic. Church leaders say three million people across the country have joined the 17,000 online services which have been held since lockdown began. Contributors have included the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Duke of Cambridge and Pope Francis.\n\nOther figures in the report show that official Church of England apps \u2013 the most popular being Daily Prayer - have been used more than seven million times so far this year, up from five million in 2019.\n\n2 Rev Marcus Walker fears a 'tragedy of historic proportions' as church attendance declines\n\nThe Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, said that during the pandemic he had seen people turning to the church for help.\n\nHe told us: \u201cSomething seems to be stirring \u2013 we\u2019ve seen people showing a hunger for comfort and meaning and the challenge now is for Christians to show people that our faith offers this.

Senior Conservative MPs now argue that because the EU has negotiated in bad faith it is time to ditch the Withdrawal Agreement in a bid to ensure the UK is free from the threat of Brussels interference. The senior source said there were signs that EU leaders are so worried about the rise of populist leaders such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen that they have prioritised domestic politics over the need to agree a trade deal with Britain.\n\nFishing was a \u201chuge stumbling block\u201d in the talks which Downing St last week declared are now \u201cover\u201d and the EU is accused of not coming close to offering a deal comparable to the free trade agreement struck with Canada. The British team suspect the EU was \u201choping to \u2018bounce\u2019 us into accepting a legal text that they have prepared in isolation\u201d. The EU, the source added, \u201cseemed to think they could run down the clock to force the UK to make concessions that would fundamentally undermine our legal and economic autonomy. If they did think that, they have made a major misjudgment about this Government compared to its predecessors.\u201d The UK side feels the EU has \u201ctaken us for a ride and not taken the process seriously\u201d. Boris Johnson will not sit down for further talks unless there is the true prospect of a breakthrough.\n\nBoris Johnson and Michel Barnier are thrashing out Brexit as the days countdown\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe PM is focused on the Covid recovery effort and would not agree to join talks that waste time on process for the sake of it. The EU must fundamentally change course or the UK will leave in Australian-style terms, under which we will thrive.\u201d The door is not completely shut on a final-hour bid to nail down a deal, but Britain is clear what must happen for that to be possible. The source said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t continue with a negotiation that was more like performance art than real engagement. That is why we told [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier that there is no point in him coming to London this week unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU. \u201cMost observers would find it incredible at this point that thanks to EU manoeuvring there is literally no agreed treaty text of any kind in place. This must change. \u201cIf it does, we are always ready to listen.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister is focused on the UK's fight against Covid-19\n\nUnless EU leaders agree a bold change in strategy, the UK now faces the real prospect of the Brexit transition phase ending without a trade agreement in place. The source said: \u201cRegardless of the negotiations, at the end of the transition period the UK is leaving the single market and customs union, meaning that there will be significant changes at the border. The Government\u2019s view is that if the EU is unwilling to negotiate a trade deal with the UK before the end of the transition period, it may be several years before we can meaningfully return to the negotiating table.\u201d Senior Brexiteers are now pressing for the Government to pull out of the Withdrawal Agreement. Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u201c[We] have to recognise that the Withdrawal Agreement, and especially the Northern Ireland protocol, contain provisions that would allow the European Court of Justice to retain jurisdiction indefinitely in some cases and that would regulate our continuing relationship with the EU. There\u2019s a wide misconception that we can simply walk away from the negotiating table and then we get away on December 31 Scot-free and that is not the case because the Withdrawal Agreement prevails beyond the end of the transition period.\u201d\n\nArguing that the UK would be justified in ditching the agreement, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got good grounds to say that the EU itself has not performed its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement. [It says] the parties must use best endeavours and act in good faith to seek to secure a free trade agreement that is respectful of the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty and the integrity of the UK internal market. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly not done that... I think it\u2019s coming to the point where we have to make it very clear to the European Union they have not observed their obligations \u2013 their legal obligations \u2013 under the Withdrawal Agreement and that being the case the United Kingdom is perfectly entitled as a matter of law to take steps to protect its own national interest.\u201d Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u201cThere is no legal reason why we should be paying any money to the EU other than our budgetary contributions.\n\nIain Duncan-Smith said the UK shouldn't be paying any money to the EU\n\n\u201cIt is now clearer than ever that the EU did not conduct these negotiations in good faith. The Prime Minister should tear up the Withdrawal Agreement and not hand over a penny more than we owe.\u201d North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen, a leading Conservative Brexiteer, said: \u201cThe Withdrawal Agreement has got to go... If there\u2019s no trade deal we need to legislate to neutralise the Withdrawal Agreement as soon as we\u2019ve left in January [and] if we do have an agreement of any sort it needs to be stated in there that it fully replaces and supersedes the Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d A letter yesterday signed by pro-Brexit organisations including Alliance of British Entrepreneurs, Brexit Facts4EU, the Bruges Group, City for Britainand Scots for Leave urged the Prime Minister to \u201crepudiate the Withdrawal Agreement\u201d. It warned: \u201cAnything else would be a betrayal of democracy, sovereignty, and international law.\u201d\n\nAndrew Bridgen has called for the Withdrawal Agreement to be scrapped\n\nThe Centre for Brexit Policy this month warned that the Government\u2019s ambition of a Canadian-style deal is \u201call but unachievable\u201d if the Withdrawal Agreement remains in place. Marco Longhi, the Conservative Dudley North MP, argues Brussels is intent on \u201cmaking an example of what happens to a member state that refuses to play any longer\u201d but says the future of the EU is now in danger. The MP, who grew up in Rome, argues that euroscepticism may intensify in Italy. He said: \u201cIn Italy there is growing disapproval of the EU; in a recent survey 42 percent of respondents said they would leave the EU, up from 26 percent in 2018... As euroscepticism builds across Europe, nation-states such as Italy should not fear the prospect of opening to the global economy.\n\nEuroscepticism could be growing in ItalyBBC Countryfile presenter Ellie Harrison has insisted that \u201cthe countryside is racist\u201d after the BBC courted controversy by reporting that many minorities see it as a \u201cwhite environment\u201d.\n\nWriting in the magazine associated with the BBC mainstay, which debuted on television over thirty years ago, Harrison said: \u201cIn asking whether the countryside is racist, then yes it is; but asking if it\u2019s more racist than anywhere else \u2014 maybe, maybe not.\u201d\n\nShe had been responding to a controversy involving BBC coverage of a government report on the supposed exclusion of minorities from the countryside, fronted by fellow presenter Dwayne Fields.\n\nThe broadcaster drew the ire of many on social media when it stated that \u201cmany in Black, Asian and minority ethnic [BAME] groups see the countryside as being a white environment\u201d on Twitter.\n\n\u201c[J]udging by the thousands of angry responses to the BBC\u2019s race-baiting tweet, there are a lot of people in Britain \u2013 both white and non-white \u2013 who object very strongly to having the natural landscape used by the BBC as a political football to advance its woke agenda,\u201d reported Breitbart columnist James Delingpole at the time.\n\nWhile @DwayneFields found solace in the landscapes of the UK and beyond, many in Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups see the countryside as being a white environment #countryfile pic.twitter.com/kjma7FuGps \u2014 BBC Countryfile (@BBCCountryfile) June 28, 2020\n\n\u201cI spooled through the comments, which broadly came in three flavours: \u2018I\u2019m not racist so there is no racism in the countryside\u2019; \u2018I\u2019m black and I\u2019ve never experienced racism in the countryside\u2019; and importantly, \u2018I have experienced racism in the countryside\u2019,\u201d Harrison said of the controversy.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s work to do. Even a single racist event means there is work to do.\u201d\n\nThe 42-year-old went on to issue something of a self-denunciation for her failure to be sufficiently strident in her anti-racism prior to the Black Lives Matter unrest, saying: \u201cUntil this point, I believed ignorantly, that me being not racist was enough. I believed that I should keep quiet and listen to black people.\u201d\n\nNow, however, she says she understands \u201cThere is a big and crucial difference between being not racist and being anti-racist\u2026 being anti-racist means being much clearer that it isn\u2019t acceptable\u2026 Let the knife and fork squeak uncomfortably over supper.\u201d\n\nThe idea that minorities are somehow persecuted when they attempt to enjoy the outdoors is also being pushed by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which runs the mega-globalist Davos summit each year.\n\nThis Black British hiker is tackling exclusion from the outdoors https://t.co/1x7P6ch8FZ pic.twitter.com/I4J31CiVkf \u2014 World Economic Forum (@wef) October 6, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery"))

Only people living in England will be affected.\n\nA memorandum of understanding between the DHSC and the National Police Chiefs Council was agreed last weekend amid concerns officers were unable to police the self-isolation rules after a positive coronavirus test without being able to verify whether individuals had been told to self-isolate. Public Health England will share the information with police on a case-by-case basis with officers expected to call a helpline to make requests as needed.\n\nThe HSJ said the office of chief medical officer Chris Whitty had \u201cexpressed significant reservations\u201d about the changes and warned it could discourage people from being tested if they knew police could access their information.\n\nA DHSC source told the HSJ: \u201cThe [CMO\u2019s office] are worried that people will simply stop getting tested because it just opens them up to the risk of being tracked by police and fined, and so the department is creating a strong disincentive to testing, which creates a big public health risk.\u201d\n\nBut a separate government source defended the changes as a \u201cbalanced and pragmatic solution\u201d to a \u201ctricky problem\u201d.\n\nThey argued that making self-isolation legally enforceable was an appropriate \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for the financial support being given to those people by government, and it was right that police had what they needed to ensure people followed the rules.\n\nThe new guidance says anyone who is told to self-isolate by NHS test and trace will be regularly contacted by phone and text. If the service is unable to reach people or they refuse to self-isolate information will be passed to local councils.\n\nThe guidance adds: \u201cIf there is evidence to suggest you are not complying with the duty to self-isolate without reasonable justification, your local authority may pass this information on to local police forces to investigate further. This may lead to enforcement action being taken against you, which could include you being fined.\u201d\n\nThe guidance also states: \u201cA police force may request information relating to positive Covid-19 tests from the NHS Test & Trace programme directly, where they are investigating a report of someone who may not be complying with the mandatory self-isolation period.\u201d\n\nA DHCS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is a legal requirement for people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and their close contacts to self-isolate when formally notified to do so.Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said the decision was based on statements by the presidents of the US, France and Russia, representing the OSCE Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by the three countries to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.The order followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014 and the first chance to vote for many young people and first-time voters. The elections were seen as an opportunity for change after years of military rule.HuffPost is part of Verizon Media.

Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded.\n\n\u201cAn independent review by the government Internal Audit Agency similarly showed the claims made by the Labour Party were false. This was not a policing matter, and we consider this was a waste of police time\u201d.\n\nIPOC director general Michael Lockwood also said in a statement: \u201cThe IOPC completed a thorough, independent and impartial assessment to determine if there were reasonable grounds to suspect the criminal offence of misconduct in public office had occurred.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence to indicate that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of any sponsorship monies to Ms Arcuri or that he influenced or played an active part in securing her participation in trade missions.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cThere was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making.\u201d\u00a9 Photo: UK PARLIAMENT / JESSICA TAYLOR British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nEuropean and British negotiators will be in touch Monday to discuss the \"structure\" of post-Brexit trade talks, despite London's threat on Friday to walk away unless there was a major shift in Brussels' approach.\n\nAn EU spokesman tweeted that chief negotiator Michel Barnier held video talks with his British counterpart David Frost on Friday after the results of European summit provoked an angry response in London.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: UK PARLIAMENT / JESSICA TAYLOR Boris Johnson on Friday kept the door open to more Brexit talks but insisted Britain was ready to slam it shut unless the EU offers \"fundamental change\".

All rights reserved.W HEN JAMES returned from the hospital after the birth of his son, he was surprised to find a bottle of whisky and some cans of lager on his doorstep. The mystery was soon solved. Under covid-19 rules, James was allowed into the hospital where his partner Annie was due to give birth only once active labour had begun. Thirty-six hours after being admitted for an induction, Annie found herself on a delivery ward in the early hours of the morning desperately trying to rouse her sleeping husband by phone. When that failed, she resorted to ordering a delivery from a local off-licence in the hope that the doorbell would prove more effective. In the event, he woke before the booze arrived.\n\nJames made it to the hospital on time and all went well. Others have not been so lucky. \u201cI\u2019ve heard real horror stories of what women have had to face alone, whether it\u2019s awful news at a scan or going through a difficult birth without your partner there,\u201d says Joeli Brearley of Pregnant Then Screwed, a campaign group. As Britain locked down in March, hospitals limited the number of visitors allowed on their premises. Pregnant women had to attend 12- and 20-week scans, and go through much of the process of labour, alone. Non-essential retail reopened in June, followed by pubs and restaurants in July, but tight restrictions have remained in place limiting access to maternity services and post-birth visits by new fathers. A petition calling for the rules to be loosened across Britain has received over 440,000 signatures and the backing of 60 MP s.\n\nThe Royal College of Midwives, a trade union and professional body, acknowledges that \u201cthe support of a partner during scans and labour is important\u201d, but argues that restricting access to some services means that \u201cmaternity teams can continue to deliver good-quality, safe care, protecting pregnant women and the midwives who care for them.\u201d Others are less convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the vast majority of birth partners live with the woman giving birth,\u201d says Jeremy Davies of the Fatherhood Institute, a think-tank. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a sudden spike in virgin conceptions.\u201d Evidence suggests the presence of partners leads to better medical outcomes, partly because it reduces stress and anxiety during birth.\n\nIn response to rising discontent the NHS issued new guidance for maternity services on September 8th. But campaigners say that interpretations of the guidelines vary widely across the country and most services remain closed to partners. The concept of \u201cactive labour\u201d is especially slippery. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this stuff runs on a timetable,\u201d says a midwife. As of late September, fewer than one in four hospital trusts were allowing partners to be present for the whole of labour and half were still banning women from being accompanied to their 12-week scan. As Ms Brearley says, \u201cNo one should have to find out they have miscarried alone.\u201d \u25a0\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.

In particular, they point out:\n\nThere is no express prohibition on authorising crimes that would constitute human rights violations, including murder, torture (e.g. punishment shootings), kidnap, or sexual offences, or on conduct that would interfere with the course of justice; The Bill relies on the Human Rights Act as a safeguard, despite the Government making clear that it does not believe that the Human Rights Act applies to abuses committed by its agents, even torture.\n\nThey added:\n\nthe Bill provides for the unprecedented \u2018legalisation\u2019 of even serious crimes by covert agents. Authorised criminal offences committed by CHIS would be rendered \u2018lawful for all purposes\u2019.\n\nThey also said:\n\nThe Bill also bars survivors of abuses, such as the victims of the \u2018Spy Cops\u2019 scandal, from seeking redress through the courts, by protecting those who commit authorised crimes from civil liability forever.\n\nLicence to kill?\n\nBut in a debate in the Commons, the solicitor general was keen to respond to the claim that the bill provides a licence to kill:\n\ncovert human intelligence sources will never be provided with unlimited authority to commit all or any crime. They will never be provided with an authorisation that is contrary to our obligations under the Human Rights Act. The Bill makes that specifically clear. This is not a \u201clicence to kill\u201d Bill.\n\nHome Office minister James Brokenshire explained how criminal conduct authorisation to a source:\n\nmay be granted only where it is necessary for one of three statutory purposes: national security, the prevention or detection of crime, or in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK.\n\nHe also said:\n\nWe do not believe, however, that it is appropriate to draw up a list of specific crimes that may be authorised or prohibited.\n\nLabour\u2019s Zarah Sultana disagreed and was forthright in her condemnation of the bill:\n\nThis Bill must be opposed. It places no limits on the crimes that state agents can be authorised to commit. It does not prohibit torture. It does not prohibit murder. \u200bIt does not prohibit sexual violence.\n\nSexual and relationship abuse\n\nWith regard to the last point, it\u2019s known that some undercover officers (UCOs) formed long-term sexual relationships with women activists to provide cover. More than thirty women are believed to have been exploited in this way.\n\nFor example, UCO Robert Lambert (cover name Bob Robinson) had relationships with four women and used those relationships to spy on animal rights and environmental activists. Here\u2019s the story of Lambert\u2019s son, fathered with \u2018Jacqui\u2019:\n\nMark Kennedy (cover name Mark Stone) also exploited women to provide cover: with \u2018Lisa Jones\u2019 over six years; with Kate (\u2018Lily\u2019) over two years; with \u2018Naomi\u2019; and with Sarah Hampton. \u2018Lisa Jones\u2019 and Kate (Wilson) explain what happened:\n\nThe Met was forced to issue an apology to the women and a spokesperson added:\n\nit has become apparent that some officers, acting undercover whilst seeking to infiltrate protest groups, entered into long-term intimate sexual relationships with women which were abusive, deceitful, manipulative and wrong.\n\nHowever, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ruled that no UCO would be prosecuted for \u201chaving non-consensual sexual relations with any member of the public\u201d.\n\nWhen infiltration goes wrong\n\n\n\nMany spycops were identified by the Undercover Research Group and other researchers. Some were members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), a Special Branch unit that infiltrated political groups between 1968 and 2008. Around 100 covert identities used by the SDS to infiltrate organisations have been identified.\n\nHM\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary revealed that 3,466 undercover operations took place in England and Wales between October 2009 and September 2013 alone. These operations were carried out by the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU) \u2013 the successor to the SDS. It also found that by 2014 a reported 1,229 officers in England and Wales were trained as UCOs. Here is a searchable list of political groups and the known UCOs who spied on them.\n\nKennedy was part of the NPOIU) \u2013 the successor to the SDS. He infiltrated and participated in the activities of numerous protest groups in the UK and across Europe (such as Scotland, north of Ireland, Irish Republic, Germany, Denmark, France and Iceland among other places). They included \u201cDissent!, Rising Tide, Saving Iceland, Workers\u2019 Solidarity Movements, Rossport Solidarity, Climate Camp, Climate Justice Action and others\u201d.\n\nTwo of the protest actions Kennedy participated in were Operation Aeroscope and Operation Pegasus. The latter saw 29 protesters convicted of various offences in 2009 after they blocked a train carrying coal heading for the Drax power station, North Yorkshire. Aeroscope resulted in a pre-emptive raid by police of a meeting to plan the invasion of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station and the arrest of 114 protesters. 26 people were accused of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass and 20 were convicted, although not jailed.\n\nA further six of the accused, who were running a different defence and were therefore facing a separate trial, exposed Kennedy\u2019s role in the action. The prosecution abandoned the trial when asked for more details about the UCO who played a part in \u201corganising and helping to fund the protest\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, it transpired the CPS knew all along of Kennedy\u2019s role in the action and during the trial of the 20 it ensured that:\n\nKennedy\u2019s evidence was kept from court. Moreover, the Independent Police Complaints Commission later found that the CPS also knew about the activists\u2019 plan, not only before it happened but before many of the activists themselves. Furthermore, Felicity Gerry, the prosecutor in the trial of the 20, had been informed about the existence of an undercover officer and had known Mark Kennedy\u2019s true identity a week before any of the activists did.\n\nConvictions quashed\n\nConsequently, the 20 also had their convictions quashed. The activists who targeted Drax power station also had their convictions quashed as a result of Kennedy\u2019s role. Here are extracts of transcripts the CPS had in its possession months prior to the Ratcliffe trial, but held back from the defence team: Page 1, Page 2, Page 3, Page 4, Page 5, Appendix. (Note: defendants\u2019 names are redacted by this author for privacy purposes).\n\nBoth the Ratcliffe and Drax cases were overseen by Nick Paul, based in the London CPS office that he shared with director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer. Starmer refused to accept that the problems Kennedy\u2019s role presented was systemic, even though there was plentiful evidence to the contrary\n\nIndeed, COPS (Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance) claims:\n\nIf the other 150 or so officers have similar tallies [as Kennedy], it means about 7,000 wrongful convictions are being left to stand. Even if we conservatively estimate just one false conviction per officer per year of service, it adds up to about 600. It may well be that spycops are responsible for the biggest nobbling of the judicial system in English history.\n\nAnother example\n\n\n\nIn 2008, a group of environmental activists were arrested in France. Nine people, known as the Tarnac 9, were initially charged with terrorism. Essentially they were accused of participating in sabotage attacks against high-speed TGV train routes. They were alleged to have done this by obstructing power cables with horseshoe-shaped iron bars, that delayed 160 trains. A judge later ruled that they wouldn\u2019t be tried for terrorism.\n\nDetective chief inspector Richard May, of the UK\u2019s NDEU (National Domestic Extremism Unit) provided assistance to the French prosecutors. It turned out the group had been infiltrated by Kennedy.\n\nOne of the defendants, Julien Coupat, contacted a UK source for further information and the entire dossier (which concerns transcripts by Kennedy) was supplied. On page 27, dated 13 June 2008, Kennedy was instructed to: \u201cput 5\u00d75 on re Halpin visiting Julien at his Farm\u201d. This is shorthand for 5x5x5 intelligence reports on page 20. \u2018Halpin\u2019 is Harry Halpin, a US citizen and core participant of the Undercover Policing Inquiry. On page 29 of the dossier, dated 4 June 2008, Kennedy confirms he received \u201cconcise instructions\u201d regarding Julien (Coupat), Halpin, and others. That information, including names of authorising officers, was relayed to the Tarnac support group by this author:\n\nAnd there was this DM:\n\nIn time, the case collapsed and all but one of the defendants \u2013 who was jailed for six months on a minor charge \u2013 were freed.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about UCOs\n\nIntelligence is not only sourced by UCOs but other actors. For example, a report by Desmond de Silva QC into the murder of north of Ireland lawyer Pat Finucane in front of his children blamed \u201cagents of the state\u201d. Referring to the British army\u2019s Force Research Unit that worked closely with the paramilitary UDA (Ulster Defence Association), SDLP MP Mark Durkan said:\n\nBetween special branch, FRU and secret services we had a culture of anything goes but nobody knows.\n\nAnd there was the \u2018black ops\u2019 unit Zeus Security, managed by Peter Hamilton. Zeus was reportedly contracted by MI5 to spy upon environmental protesters who tried to halt the building of Sizewell \u2018B\u2019 nuclear reactor in Suffolk. Gary Murray explained that Hamilton was:\n\na former member of Army Intelligence, where he held the rank of Major. Documents and tapes in my possession link this man to the highest echelons of British Intelligence.\n\nHe added:\n\nDuring my investigation I successfully recorded conversations with Hamilton admitting his services were being utilised by the Economic League.\n\nThis author discovered that Zeus was financed by James Goldsmith (named in an unpublished version of \u2018Spycatcher\u2019 by former British spy Peter Wright as one of several persons who sought to ensure the Labour Party would not return to government). Zeus was owned by Antonio von Marx, Goldsmith\u2019s nephew. Murray claimed that the murder of Sizewell B protester Hilda Murrell was conducted by \u201cprivate investigators or security consultants acting on behalf of a government department\u201d.\n\nLord Chalfont joined the board of Zeus in 1981, but once his role was revealed (again, by this author) he was forced to resign his position as head of the Independent Broadcasting Authority.\n\nThere\u2019s also the private operators\n\nChalfont was also linked to private surveillance operator Paul Mercer, who infiltrated various campaign groups. In 2007, Mercer was exposed for his role in monitoring the Campaign Against Arms Trade. His contract was via Global Open (GO), a private surveillance firm. GO included Kennedy and Rod Leeming (formerly of Special Branch). Between 1987 and 1991 Mercer served as the Conservative Borough Councillor in Charnwood.\n\nAt a January 2011 meeting organised by think tank Policy Exchange, Mercer claimed to have \u201ccovered and having been on pretty well every major public order disturbance in London over that period\u201d, including the Poll Tax Riots of 1990 and Mayday 2001.\n\nNot forgetting blacklisting\n\nDuring the Commons debate on the CHIS bill, MP Nick Thomas-Symonds referred to a Metropolitan police\u2019s investigation into police collusion in blacklisting that concluded:\n\non the balance of probabilities, the allegation that the police or special branches supplied information is \u2018proven.\u2019 Material revealed a potentially improper flow of information from Special Branch to external organisations, which ultimately appeared on the blacklist.\n\nIndeed, the Met admitted collusion and that thousands of its files on undercover policing went \u2018missing\u2018 or were destroyed.\n\nThe main blacklisting intelligence agency was the Economic League (EL), which has a long history of collaboration (diagram courtesy of Spies At Work):\n\nThe EL collapsed after activists published internal documents showing it was financially unviable. It\u2019s estimated that at least 40,000 workers were blacklisted by several hundred companies subscribed to the EL. One victim was actor Ricky Tomlinson, who was previously a plasterer. He was secretly targeted by prime minister Edward Heath with the assistance of the Information Research Department (IRD), a Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) funded propaganda unit.\n\nHere\u2019s Tomlinson\u2019s story:\n\nMore blacklisting collusion\n\nThe EL\u2019s successor was the much smaller Consulting Association (CA). More than 3,000 construction workers were targeted by that agency.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) suggested that police colluded in the Consulting Association\u2019s blacklist, saying it was \u201clikely that all special branches were involved in providing information\u201d.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s known that detective chief inspector Gordon Mills of the NPIOU\u2019s sister unit, the National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit (NETCU), met with the CA. Here is a leaked copy of notes from that meeting.\n\nDitch the bill\n\n\n\nAs shown, the deployment of human intelligence sources can easily lead to relationship abuse. And infiltration can also result in miscarriages of justice. Such sources may also, wittingly or otherwise, provide information that can contribute to blacklisting of one sort or another.\n\nDespite government caveats, the CHIS bill is possibly one of the most dangerous to be put before parliament in decades. It should not be amended but ditched.\n\nFeatured image supplied with permissionThe Electoral Commission (EC) is soon to be reviewed by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Its independence could be under threat. And this means our democracy is also threatened.\n\nThe last decade has seen Britain\u2019s electoral landscape move from the cash for honours scandal, various expenses scandals, to the recent flurry of elections and referendums that have come under scrutiny with accusations of electoral fraud and dodgy campaign finances.\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder that public confidence in politicians and the election process is so low. But removing the independence of the EC will not instill greater confidence. The electoral commission needs reform, not abolition.\n\nThe Canary will be keeping a keen eye on the progress of this review in our mission to hold truth to power. This article is, therefore, the first in a series that will investigate this issue from all angles. We\u2019ll keep pressure on political parties who could threaten the democratic process at a time when public confidence in politics is at an all-time low.\n\nThe review is not expected until June 2021. The public consultation, however, has already been carried out and there are a number of issues to explore that hold politicians across the spectrum to account\n\nThe threat\n\nThe EC has been an independent body since 2001. It monitors elections and helps the election process happen. The EC was formed from the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA).\n\nThe Committee on Standards in Public Life has announced a review of electoral regulation in the UK. And there are significant concerns that the Conservative government is looking to severely restrict or abolish the EC altogether.\n\nCo-chair of the Conservative Party Amanda Milling warned that if the EC did not accept further scrutiny and reforms:\n\nand do the job it was set up to do then the only option would be to abolish it.\n\nFair Vote UK countered Milling\u2019s comments by stating:\n\nFair Vote UK agrees that the Commission needs to change \u2013 and we stressed this in our own submission to the review \u2013 but Milling\u2019s main protests are disingenuous and circular in logic. Firstly, The Electoral Commission is accountable. To Parliament, not Government. This is designed to ensure its non-partisan political independence. It reports to the Speaker of the House of Commons, is governed by the rule of law and is answerable to the courts. Independent regulatory bodies of this type are a common part of the UK constitution. Ask yourself, would an electoral regulator directly answerable to No. 10 be trusted as independent?\n\nOptions for reform\n\nThe EC could well do with reform that hands them greater investigative powers. It is, for example, currently restricted by outdated election laws that don\u2019t account for digital advertising from election and referendum campaigns. This is further compounded by low fines (something the Scottish government tried to remedy by increasing the maximum fine from \u00a310,000 to \u00a3500,000 for campaigns that break rules during referendums). An inefficient relationship to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) also means that EC investigations run under massive delays.\n\nClearly, there is room for careful reform of the EC in order to provide accountability for campaigning tactics during elections and referendums.\n\nIn the West, there is a mixture of electoral models. Countries such as Germany, and Spain use a mixed model where independent regulators monitor elections. These recommendations are put into action by governments and monitored. Others, such as the US and Sweden use an executive model whereby branches of local government act on behalf of a central body.\n\nWhile the mixed model could be an option in the UK, are we really going to trust this government to carry that out?\n\nDiscrepancies from Vote Leave and the Tory government itself during election seasons have shown that we cannot.\n\nA call to vigilance\n\nIndependent regulation is a deeply important part of a functioning democracy.\n\nThe Conservative government\u2019s slow privatisation of the NHS, its abject failure to implement an effective Test and Trace system, and the continuation of a hostile environment has shown that it cannot be trusted to hold the values of integrity and decency in its actions.\n\nDemocracy is not a singular and stable entity unchanged by political upheaval. Democracy is a process that is vulnerable to manipulation and erosion. Democracy is something that we do. The suggestion of potentially abolishing the EC is a dangerous threat to democracy in the UK. It must be closely watched and resisted.\n\nFeatured image via secretlondon123/FlickrBoom. Bam. You know who it is. This is Drillminister, aka Young Drilly \u2013 writing for The Canary. People know me for using my music to fight back against political violence; using words as a weapon against the repression of the poorest people in our society:\n\nBut now, I\u2019ve got to take it to another level.\n\nAn opposition that doesn\u2019t oppose\n\nSince Jeremy Corbyn was hounded out of the Labour Party by the right-wing guard dogs in our billionaire-owned mainstream media, our chances for a fair and equal Britain have been torn from the bones of our society.\n\nIt\u2019s been replaced by an opposition that does not oppose; forcing its members to abstain from voting against the Overseas Operations Bill \u2013 legislation that could literally make it easier to commit war crimes.\n\nWe have a resistance that doesn\u2019t resist. It\u2019s one that says nothing, as journalists like Julian Assange who expose war crimes are sat up in the dock like a criminal.\n\nOh wait, hold on.\n\nWasn\u2019t Sir Keir Starmer head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) when they contacted Assange\u2019s Swedish prosecutors to tell them not to drop the case?\n\nAnd if that\u2019s what\u2019s left for us, what\u2019s on the right?\n\nLegally breaking the law\n\nAn openly racist, blonde buffoon, leading a party that has punished poor and disabled people with benefit sanctions. A party that\u2019s left people to starve to death in one of the richest countries in the world.\n\nA governing party, whose chief advisor can openly break the law without getting any shit.\n\nAnd why not?\n\nIf it\u2019s legal for the government to sell arms to Saudi Arabia and train pilots that\u2019ll help to bomb civilians in Yemen \u2013 the poorest country in the Middle East with tens of millions of men, women, and children in need of humanitarian aid \u2013 then what?\n\nIf it\u2019s legal to give out government contracts worth billions of pounds to businesses linked to high-ranking members of government \u2013 without competition and in a time of national crisis \u2013 then what?\n\nIf it\u2019s legal to allow the world\u2019s biggest companies to avoid paying tax, losing the country billions of pounds every year \u2013 then what?\n\nThen, maybe we need new laws. Maybe we need new leaders.\n\nThe revolution is coming. So is Drillminister.\n\nI am running for London mayor in 2021 because we need a change from this disgusting duopoly that our political system has become.\n\nI am building a manifesto that comes from the bottom up; building a better London by working with those who are currently experiencing the worst of it.\n\nOur campaign needs to hear from those the elites want to ignore.\n\nSo, if you want justice \u2013 justice for Grenfell, justice for poor people, and justice for minorities \u2013 vote for Drillminister.\n\nWatch Drillminister explain further why he is running for London mayor in 2021:\n\nFeatured image and additional images via DrillministerImagine being spied upon, not just by one undercover police officer, but by at least six. This is what happened to environmental activist Kate Wilson. And now the police have finally admitted that this surveillance of Wilson breached her human rights.\n\nIn 2003, Wilson met undercover police officer Mark Kennedy, and they lived together as lovers for two years. He deceived her and numerous others he became friends with, hiding his real identity as a police spy. Kennedy infiltrated a number of protest groups and gatherings in the UK and across Europe, including Climate Camp, Earth First, and animal rights gatherings.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the devastating effects that Kennedy has had on Wilson: the trauma she has faced. And yet the new admission by the police shows the terrifying lengths that the police will go to in order to spy on campaigners and activists.\n\nAccording to Police Spies Out of Lives, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) have admitted that:\n\nDespite this, the police:\n\ncontinue to claim that authorisations for surveillance of Kate and the environmental and social justice movements she was active in were lawful and legitimate\n\n\u2018Systematically abusing women since 1968\u2019\n\nWilson has explained that police units \u201chave been systematically abusing women since 1968.\u201d She said that these new admissions:\n\nhave wide reaching significance for the public at large. Over 30 women now know that they were deceived into intimate, sexual relationships with undercover officers. Many more people were subjected to similar infiltration by undercover officers. What happened to me was by no means unique, and hundreds of people will have had their rights violated in this way. These admissions mean it is simply not sustainable to say these operations were legitimate, proportionate, or lawful.\n\nAnd yet the government is going to legalise police spies\u2019 criminal activities\n\nThe admissions that Wilson\u2019s human rights were violated are likely to make no difference to the Tory government. It\u2019s currently progressing a bill to legalise the criminal activities of undercover officers and agents working for the police, MI5, and other state agencies. These agents are known as Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS).\n\nAccording to The Canary\u2019s Tom Coburg, the new CHIS bill \u201cis possibly one of the most dangerous bills to be put before the country in decades, legalising highly discredited practices\u201d.\n\nHuman rights organisations have pointed out that:\n\nThere is no express prohibition on authorising crimes that would constitute human rights violations, including murder, torture (e.g. punishment shootings), kidnap, or sexual offences, or on conduct that would interfere with the course of justice\n\nAnd so, if undercover agents can literally get away with murder, then there will likely be no limit to the extent that they can violate women\u2019s lives and get away with it.\n\nPolice Spies Out of Lives argues that:\n\nKate has fought this case [against the police] for 9 years. She has faced repeated attempts to shut down and delay her case, and fears this [new bill] may be the start of another attempt to close the case down and avoid further scrutiny.\n\nThe abuse and objectification of women by police spies spotlights institutional sexism within the UK. The fact that the government wants to introduce a bill which gives these spies complete impunity means there\u2019s likely to be no end to the psychological, sexual, and emotional abuse of women at the hands of the state.\n\nFeatured image via Police Spies Out Of LivesClose to the end of Hari Kunzru\u2019s new novel, Red Pill, the narrator is telling a Manhattan therapist about his deranged attempts to expose Anton, an alt-right screenwriter who he believes is stirring up dangerous political forces. The therapist scoffs that Anton\u2019s television shows hardly make him a significant figure: \u201cDragons, that sort of thing. Surely I could see that this was not a field for anyone with serious political ambitions. It would be hard to think of anything more purely escapist.\u201d But he demurs: \u201cThere were underground currents, new modes of propagation. It wasn\u2019t even a question of ideas, not straightforwardly, but feelings, atmospheres, yearnings, threats\u2026 Essentially I was talking about fascism.\u201d The therapist dismisses it as anxiety about the presidential election. It is polling day, 8 November 2016.\n\nThe narrator is a restless New York intellectual who accepts a fellowship at the Deuter Centre, an interdisciplinary institute at Wannsee, outside Berlin. Alienated by its clinical and rigid atmosphere he takes long, bleak walks around the lake; encountering the grave of the romantic poet Heinrich von Kleist, the villa where the Nazis devised the \u201cfinal solution\u201d, and a former East German punk haunted by her past as a Stasi informant. He also lurks in his room, binge-watching footage from war zones and Blue Lives, a trashy cop drama whose nihilism and unacknowledged quotes from an anti-rationalist opponent of the French Revolution beguile him. Meeting Anton, the show\u2019s Nordic supremacist writer, in Berlin, he develops an obsession, pursuing Anton to Paris and a Scottish island.\n\nBack in New York, his wife is devastated by his melodramatic self-absorption, friends regard him with pity and detachment and the therapist dismisses his sense of dread about the future. The novel concludes as his wife\u2019s fashionable Brooklynite circle gathers to watch the election results coverage, champagne at the ready to toast a Hillary Clinton win and the natural next step on a timeline in which \u201cthe future is predictable, an extrapolation from the past, a steady progression\u201d. Donald Trump triumphs, their world collapses and suddenly the momentum seems to be with Anton\u2019s people, the alt-right trolls with their memes, in-jokes, sinister Nordic symbology and conspiracy theories; a rival timeline in which \u201call this normality is a paper screen over something bloody and atavistic that is rising up out of history to meet us\u201d. It occurs to the narrator: \u201cMy madness\u2026 is about to become everyone\u2019s madness.\u201d\n\nA presence looms over Red Pill but is not named in it: Friedrich Nietzsche. He looms thematically, as the supreme theorist to emerge from the mists of German Romanticism. And he looms intellectually, his arguments echoing in the contrast that strikes Kunzru\u2019s narrator towards the novel\u2019s end. The world experienced by the narrator at Wannsee and in Anton\u2019s oeuvre is not the orderly, rational, linear system of the therapist or the Brooklyn sophisticates, what Nietzsche dubbed the Apollonian. It is revealed disorder, frenzy, urges and appetites, or what the philosopher dubbed the Dionysian. Nietzsche argued that Greek tragedy\u2019s synthesis of the Apollonian and the Dionysian \u2013 order forged in the very affirmation of the chaos of reality \u2013 made it the highest and purest form of art. It is such a tragic synthesis that Anton finds in his fascistic nihilism, and that the narrator, too, finds in his own, doomed quest to stop Anton.\n\nFour years on from the fictional Brooklyn party, the \u201cmadness\u201d seemingly unleashed at the last US presidential election has indeed become \u201ceveryone\u2019s madness\u201d to some extent. Established assumptions about the march of progress are not gone, but are less glib and more qualified. The Dionysian forces \u2013 tribes and masses, mysticism and disorder \u2013 have announced their presence behind the paper screen. It is now widely accepted that desiccated liberalism, the weightless technocracy of \u201cStronger Together\u201d (Clinton 2016) or \u201cStronger, Safer and Better Off\u201d (Remain) is vulnerable when up against rival offerings that speak to the human yearning for emotional story-telling, for operatic goodies and baddies, for the recognisable narrative of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (Trump 2016) or a \u201cTake Back Control\u201d (Leave). Once more a US presidential election approaches and once more a liberal candidate looks likely to win. But this time few are willing to predict that outcome with confidence.\n\nEven if Joe Biden does triumph on 3 November, this should not be mistaken for a restoration of some temporarily disrupted order. The Dionysian will still lurk below the surface, and with it myriad chances, for those willing to take them, to mould it into forms and stories. Trump will almost certainly decry the result as illegitimate, urging his supporters to agitate against it. Violence may ensue. Disinformation and myths will continue to ripple across social media. More previously apolitical types, isolated by lockdowns and spending too long online, will be drawn into conspiracy theories such as the QAnon claims that Trump is secretly battling an elite, Satan-worshiping paedophile ring; modern-day Quixotes driven mad by reading too many fanciful tales.\n\nNone of which is to say that these threats should be overblown in a way that flatters their propagators, or to deny that humans also have an immense capacity for reason and science and individuality. But it is to remind ourselves that there is something universal, eternal and, like it or not, innately human about the atavistic passions that seemed to come out of nowhere four years ago. They existed beforehand and will long outlive any Biden presidency. \u201cFeelings, atmospheres, yearnings, threats\u201d will still shape and define experience. History will not be over, nor will it have been proved to be linear. Stories will still matter.One of Wole Olubanji\u2019s friends had left a wedding party one evening when he was stopped by officers from Nigeria\u2019s notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars), a specialist police unit. The officers didn\u2019t like the look of the young man, who wears his hair in dreadlocks. They marched him to a cash machine and ordered him to withdraw 40,000 naira ($100), leaving him with 3,000 naira (less than $10) in his bank account. Olubanji says his friend was powerless to resist, fearing a beating or worse were he to refuse to pay off the goons.\n\nThe episode epitomises discontent with Sars, a unit of the Nigerian police created nearly 30 years ago to combat violent crimes such as kidnappings and robberies. Originally welcomed in some communities scarred by crime, its methods \u2013 alleged torture, unlawful arrests, extra-judicial killings \u2013 began to resemble those of the criminals it purported to be fighting. A notorious Abuja detention centre run by the unit is nicknamed \u201cthe abattoir\u201d. Between January 2017 and May 2020, a report by Amnesty International found there were more than 80 alleged cases of torture, ill treatment and extra-judicial execution by Sars, not a single one of which resulted in prosecution. Olubanji is now one of thousands of Nigerians to have joined protests calling for the unit to be disbanded. The protests, in which, according to Amnesty, at least ten people have been killed, were triggered by a string of viral videos showing Sars use brutal and likely illegal tactics, with one clip apparently showing a man being badly beaten.\n\nThe government has given in to pressure from demonstrators and has announced that the unit will be dissolved, though the army subsequently issued a veiled warning, ordering protestors to \u201cdesist\u201d. Critics, including Leena Koni Hoffmann, an associate fellow of the Africa Programme at the think tank Chatham House, warn that reform of the security services is frequently promised but rarely delivered. \u201cEven while the president was announcing that Sars would be disbanded, police were shooting live ammunition and water cannons at peaceful protestors. So this will be an uphill struggle,\u201d Hoffmann says.\n\nAnger with law enforcement is nothing new in Nigeria. The country\u2019s police force evolved from colonial era institutions and still perceives its role as protecting the interests of the ruling regime rather than citizens themselves, says Lanre Ikuteyijo, a researcher at Obafemi Awolowo University in southwestern Nigeria. But this year, young Nigerians are angry and bored. Universities have been closed to slow the spread of coronavirus, leaving students to stew at home. \u201cThe economy is not smiling,\u201d Ikuteyijo adds \u2013 an understatement. Nigeria is forecast to suffer its worst recession for four decades this year. Grainy videos of police brutality crystallised young people\u2019s worries, and fit within a global mood of simmering rage at law enforcement, triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US in May this year.\n\nWhether the government can succeed in disbanding Sars and tackling police brutality will serve as a test for Nigeria\u2019s fledgling democracy, which experienced its first democratic transfer of power five years ago. Activists fear officers will merely be reallocated to other units without being retrained or disciplined, and that this will simply spread a culture of abuse around rather than curbing it. Nigeria\u2019s track record on institutional reform suggests they are right to be sceptical.\n\n[See also: How the protests swept the world]This website uses cookies to help us give you the best experience when you visit our website.

If so, he has just been handed the perfect place to eke out his final days \u2013 by playing golf on a new course in Aberdeenshire, his second in the area.\n\nIf Trump does choose such an option, he can expect a robust welcome from conservationists, however. They say last week\u2019s decision by Aberdeenshire council planners to approve the course could have a catastrophic impact on the area\u2019s delicate environment.\n\nTrump International Golf Links Scotland built a course on the Menie estate, north of Aberdeen, in 2012, and its construction has been blamed for badly damaging the spectacular dunes system at nearby Foveran Links, an official site of special scientific interest (SSSI).\n\nAs a result, conservation experts had urged Aberdeenshire council to withhold planning permission for the second golf course at Menie that Trump had asked to build. But in September last year, local councillors ignored their warnings and recommended the proposal be given the go-ahead.\n\nSince then, campaigners had pressed Aberdeenshire council planning service to overturn that decision but on Friday it announced it had decided to go ahead and grant full planning permission for the new course. It claimed the new course \u201cwill contribute towards the significant social and economic benefits expected to be delivered by the wider development proposals within the Menie estate\u201d.\n\nThis optimism is not shared by conservationists. They say that the decision means Foveran\u2019s SSSI status \u2013 given because of its unusual shifting sands and diverse plant life \u2013 will have to be removed completely in the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis decision gives a green light to the Trump organisation to further vandalise and destroy Scotland\u2019s natural heritage,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. \u201cAberdeenshire council and the Scottish government have ignored the objections of Scottish Natural Heritage about potential further damage to world-famous sand dunes that are supposed to be protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, but which have already been partially destroyed by the building of the first golf course.\u201d\n\nThe new 18-hole course will be known as MacLeod course after Mr Trump\u2019s mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born and brought up on the Hebridean island of Lewis before emigrating to New York. The course will be built to the south and west of the original one.\n\nTrump originally won approval for his \u201cTrump estate\u201d encompassing the protected dunes because he pledged to create up to 6,000 jobs by building a five-star hotel with 450 rooms, shops, a sports complex, timeshare flats, two golf courses and housing estates. However, so far he has constructed only one 18-hole course, which is open seven months a year, a practice range, and a small clubhouse with a restaurant and shop; he also converted Menie\u2019s manor house into a boutique hotel with 16 rooms.\n\nWith just over a fortnight until election day, the chances of Trump spending more time on his golf courses appear to be increasing. His Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, leads by 17 points in the latest Opinium Research/Guardian poll. More than 18 million votes have already been cast.\n\nAs well as leading in the national opinion polls, Biden is also consistently ahead in a series of crucial swing states. Last week he even won the ratings war \u2013 more Americans tuned in to see his Q&A session on ABC than Trump\u2019s version on NBC.\n\nAberdeenshire residents may be seeing Trump soon, win or lose. According to www.trumpgolfcount.com, Trump has played more rounds of golf as president than any other White House resident. He has visited his golf clubs 280 times during his presidency, playing on 140 occasions.A new constitution was approved in a referendum in March. Mr Cond\u00e9 argues this means he is allowed to seek re-election, even though he had already served the maximum of two terms allowed under the previous constitution.A creeping feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu has been haunting Westminster with the arrival of autumn as bulletin after bulletin carries more bad news about the dreaded resurgence of Covid-19.\n\nCase numbers, hospitalisations and, of course, deaths are rising and the R value has stayed stubbornly above 1.0, meaning that the pandemic continues to grow across the country.\n\nThe UK map is a patchwork quilt of varying social distancing restrictions, reflecting how Boris Johnson wants to stick to his \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d strategy of stamping out outbreaks and avoiding blanket bans.\n\nBut with around a third of the entire UK population now living under some form of local lockdown, the question many are asking is: why doesn\u2019t the prime minister \u201cgo the whole hog\u201d and back a full second national lockdown?\n\nChief medical officer Chris Whitty, who with the PM and chief scientific officer Patrick Vallance, led a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, has warned the country faces a \u201csix-month problem\u201d.\n\nThere are \u201csignificant rates of transmission\u201d in \u201cgreat majority\u201d of areas where the virus is spiking, he said.\n\nPointing to alarming graphs showing that hospital admissions were rising sharply among the over-65s, Vallance warned it would be \u201cwrong\u201d to think that the problem was only in areas under local lockdowns.\n\n\u201cIt is worst in certain areas but there is evidence of spread everywhere,\u201d he said\n\nSo what is stopping the PM from a full lockdown \u2013 and could a two-week \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d compromise be on the cards?\n\nThe devastating impact on the economy\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak holds a virtual news conference in Downing Street\n\nCovid-19 has already ravaged the UK economy and the Bank of England warned last month that the resurgence of the virus will hit the country hard.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is thought to oppose a second lockdown \u201cfor any long period of time\u201d amid fears job losses could soar and unemployment in 2021 could spiral out of control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant balancing act, trying to keep the country moving forward without the hospitals filling up with critically ill patients with Covid so that other services can continue to run, but achieving that is the key point,\u201d said one MP.\n\n\u201cAnd if that isn\u2019t happening [to the NHS], then keeping people running their businesses and employing people is equally important.\u201d\n\nData released by the Office for National Statistics revealed that the number of redundancies in the UK has risen at its fastest pace since the financial crisis.\n\nMany economists think Sunak\u2019s new wage subsidy scheme is unlikely to stem further job losses this winter.\n\n\u201cThe economic challenges are huge,\u201d said the MP. \u201cIf the economy slows down too much \u2013 well, we use it to pay all of our public sector, it\u2019s not for the fun of it. It pays for the wages for all of the services we want for our constituents.\u201d\n\nLibertarian \u2018Brady bunch\u2019 Tory backbenchers\n\nTOLGA AKMEN via Getty Images Conservative MP Graham Brady\n\nOne thorn in Johnson\u2019s side should he move for a second shutdown is a grouping of backbench Tory MPs known informally as \u201cthe Brady bunch\u201d.\n\nNotionally led by the chair of the powerful 1922 committee, Graham Brady, they oppose new restrictions by the state, both due to the limits on individual freedoms and the strain on business.\n\nOr, as Brady recently put it, they feel the government has \u201cgot into the habit of ruling by decree\u201d during Covid-19, with many measures, including hefty fines, announced without parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nOne moderate Tory MP, who doesn\u2019t back the would-be rebels, told HuffPost UK other MPs were more trenchant in their view: \u201cThe Hitchenite wing, or lockdown-sceptic wing of the party, is growing stronger and stronger.\n\n\u201cThey are very hardline and there are more and more of them. They have increasing influence via people like Toby Young and Laurence Fox and then Nigel Farage on the fringe.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cSome of it is for libertarian reasons \u2013 they don\u2019t want people to be bossed around by the state \u2013 but for others it is genuine worry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the libertarian arguments but I really do worry about businesses in my constituency and job losses.\u201d\n\nThe group, which is thought to be around 50 strong, won a concession from the government last month after threatening a rebellion over the continuation of emergency measures.\n\nNow, any second national lockdown must be put to a vote in the Commons.\n\nWhile backbench voices may chip away at Johnson\u2019s authority, they have little chance of sinking a second lockdown, given the Tories\u2019 80-seat majority.\n\nBut the PM may also look to swerve a face-off with his detractors by brokering a compromise.\n\nHow to save Christmas\n\nPA Christmas lights are used to show appreciation for the NHS on a house in Cambridge Drive in Chandler's Ford near Eastleigh, Southampton\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental belief in central government that the British public will not stand for a fully locked-down Christmas or even the rule of six, frankly,\u201d one source close to the government told HuffPost UK.\n\nInstead of \u201ccancelling Christmas\u201d, a two-week \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d national lockdown, starting October 23, is on the table and may allow the country to avoid tighter restrictions later, it is said.\n\nA government source told HuffPost UK a range of data is used to make decisions, and that there is no \u201cspecific point\u201d at which a second shutdown would be triggered.\n\nSetting an end date on a \u201cfull fat\u201d lockdown would solve more than one problem for the PM.\n\nOctober 23 is the start of half term, meaning schoolchildren \u2013 who have missed out since March, with those from poorer backgrounds hit hardest \u2013 could avoid having a great deal more of their classroom education interrupted.\n\nSo the move may satisfy working parents and teachers who fear youngsters are falling behind with lessons.\n\nThis \u201cthird way\u201d plan is said to have been briefed to hostile MPs already as a \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d this winter.\n\n\u201cI think with backbenchers you can sell drastic measures in the short term, that are time limited, by saying: if all goes well, we will open up at Christmas,\u201d the source added.\n\nRetail and hospitality businesses, struggling to keep their head above water, would similarly be more inclined to swallow measures if they had an end in sight.\n\nBrady, meanwhile, told BBC Radio 4\u2032s Westminster Hour on Sunday that \u201cpeople were told that it was a finite thing\u201d when lockdown was first imposed.\n\nHe added piecemeal regional lockdowns were now being questioned by the public.\n\nBrady said: \u201cPeople were remarkably tolerant in being prepared to go along with that, I think for that reason. And when you then start to get to speculation about a second lockdown or all of these regional things, I think patience really does start to wear thin and I can understand that.\u201d\n\nThe government on Sunday revealed that as many as 16,000 cases from last week were not added to government figures, with the UK recording a huge 22,921 lab-confirmed cases in the 24 hours up to 9am on Sunday.\n\nThe news flatly contradicts suggestions that the second wave may have been \u201clevelling off\u201d, as it is now known the country reached 10,000 new daily cases on September 30.\n\nMinisters are being shown more drastic figures by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific office Patrick Vallance, one source said.\n\n\u201cThe numbers that [the cabinet] are seeing are very, very bad and the thing that is always repeated to them by Whitty and Vallance in the meetings they have, is this [data] is two weeks\u2019 old, so what is happening now is worse than what I\u2019m showing you,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cSo they show ministers a lot of numbers that are bad but say that \u2018before I do, know this, it is worse\u2019.\u201d\n\nRumblings of disquiet in the Red Wall\n\nPA Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham\n\nWith vast swathes of the north under local lockdown already and widespread confusion, not least by Johnson himself, over what measures are in place where, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham sounded the alarm on Sunday.\n\nTelling the government it is \u201cin danger of losing the public in the north of England\u201d, he said: \u201cWe need a bit of a reset.\u201d\n\nThe Labour mayor\u2019s view is shared by several Tory MPs representing his party\u2019s former heartlands, HuffPost UK understands.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday, the former health minister \u2013 who has previously claimed Covid-19 could do more damage to the north than Margaret Thatcher \u2013 added: \u201cActually if [the government] carry on imposing restrictions on the north without proper support for the businesses and the employees affected in the north, we will see a winter of \u2018levelling down\u2019 and the north-south divide getting bigger.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth has pointed out that \u2013 by contrast \u2013 few Tory ministers have seen local lockdowns in their constituencies, suggesting there even may be \u201cpolitical interference\u201d.\n\nIt is feared the economic long-term impact could disproportionately leave the Red Wall \u2013 across the midlands, north and Wales \u2013 much worse off, with many jobs lost in retail and hospitality.\n\n\u201cThey expect this to hit the Red Wall worse than anywhere,\u201d said one insider.\n\n\u201cThere are MPs who think the government worries too much about the Red Wall, and say there are other areas of the country and other people who voted Tory, but it\u2019s definitely true that the first test of any policy outside of Covid is the Red Wall test.\u201d\n\nOne northern Tory simply added: \u201cIt\u2019s a constantly moving challenge of keeping the economy moving and ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cI think we all need to accept that we will be living a quiet life for the next year.\u201dCertain crimes, such as counterfeiting currency or mail theft, are automatically tried at a federal level, as are cases in which the US is a party or those which involve constitutional violations.
