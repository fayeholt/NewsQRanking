They complain that the advice from scientists is not being appropriately balanced with advice from economists and people in business.The man who beheaded a history teacher in a Parisian suburb asked students to point out his victim before he launched the attack on Friday afternoon.\n\nAs more details emerged of the grisly murder, authorities named the teacher as Samuel Paty, 47.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday the country\u2019s fight against Islamic terrorism was \u201cexistential\u201d after the teacher was killed in the wake of showing his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad from French satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo.\n\nMr Paty taught history and geography at the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, 30 km (20 miles) northwest of Paris.\n\nFrench police said the suspect was an 18-year-old born in Moscow of Chechen origin. He had been granted a 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March and was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.\n\nFrance's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office said that authorities investigating the killing have also arrested nine suspects, including the grandparents, parents and 17-year-old brother of the attacker.\n\nPolice said they opened fire after the attacker failed to respond to orders to put down his arms and acted in a threatening manner.\n\nThe teacher had received threats after opening a discussion \"for a debate\" about caricatures about 10 days ago, a police official told the Associated Press. The parent of a student had filed a complaint against the teacher, another police official said.\n\nThe French anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the suspect's phone. Mr Ricard said the suspect had been seen at the school asking students about the teacher, and the headmaster had received several threatening phone calls.\n\nThe man who beheaded the teacher outside the school where he taught had approached pupils in the street and asked them to point out his victim, Mr Ricard said on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Mr Ricard also said that the attacker, after beheading the teacher, had posted a photograph of the teacher's body on Twitter, accompanied by a message saying he had carried out the killing.\n\nCharlie Hebdo tweeted: \u201cCharlie Hebdo expresses its sense of horror and revolt after a teacher in the line of duty was murdered by a religious fanatic. We express our deepest support to his family, loved ones and all the teachers.\n\n\u201cIntolerance has just crossed a new threshold and seems to stop at nothing to impose its terror on our country. Only the determination of political power and the solidarity of all will defeat this fascist ideology. This filthy act mourns our democracy but must make us more combative than ever to defend our freedom.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Prime Minister Jean Castex said France will react with the greatest firmness in the wake of the teacher\u2019s beheading.\n\n\"Through one of its defenders, it is the Republic which has been struck in the heart by Islamist terrorism,\" Mr Castex tweeted.\n\n\"In solidarity with its teachers, the State will react with the greatest firmness so that the Republic and its citizens live, free! We will never give up. Never.\"\n\nCaroline Fourest, a prominent French feminist journalist who is a former Charlie Hebdo columnist, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u201cI was very, very shocked. Not that this murder was a surprise \u2013 now we have lived for almost eight years under the permanent threat of terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly shocked because this attack targets a teacher. In the history of the French Republic, teachers symbolise a very special figure. The one who gives you hope for unity and fraternity.\n\n\u201cSometimes we have the feeling that this battle against religious fanaticism is endless but the only secret hope we have is that teachers, with their patience and pedagogy, will be able to block and diffuse hatred and fanaticism in the heart of the next generation by making them understand satirical culture, Charlie Hebdo, and freedom of speech. But yesterday a bit of that hope was beheaded.\u201d\n\nShe argued those who \u201cdare to\u201d defend secularism and freedom of speech in the country are under great strain.\n\nMs Fourest added: \u201cWe cannot win a war because it is an asymmetric war, between reason on one side and madness on the other side. You can be patient and precise. You can explain again and again and again.\u201d\n\nHer comments come after two journalists from a film production firm were stabbed with a meat cleaver outside the old offices of Charlie Hebdo three weeks ago.\n\nAn 18-year-old man from Pakistan who was arrested for the attack told police he was upset Charlie Hebdo had republished caricatures of the prophet of Islam.\n\nFourteen people who are suspected of being involved in the 2015 terror attack on Charlie Hebdo, which took place after the paper published caricatures of the prophet of Islam are currently on trial in Paris \u2013 with the trial set to go on until November.\n\nIn the French National Assembly, the equivalent of parliament, deputies stood up to pay tribute to the teacher.B usinesses asking the government to swoop in and hit them with a new regulatory requirement backed by the force of law?

If a deal is not struck and signed in time for the end of the deadline, the UK will leave the bloc\u2019s institutions and trade with it on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.\n\nSo far, the EU and its negotiator, Michel Barnier, have refused to soften on London\u2019s red lines, such as regaining full control of the UK\u2019s waters, regulations, and laws. Some European leaders have said that they will resist any deal unless current fishing rights are retained, and the UK agrees to restrict itself by abiding by \u2018level playing field\u2019 rules.\n\nHowever, for a deal to be struck, it needs to be mutually beneficial. The UK has already demonstrated that it is capable of signing such deals with third nations, after agreeing in principle early last month a free trade agreement with Japan that is due to be signed next week.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a Political, Free Trade, and Strategic Partnership Agreement between their countries which aims \u201cto strengthen UK cooperation in political, security and foreign matters with Ukraine, while also securing continued preferential trade for businesses and consumers\u201d \u2014 essentially, a continuation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.\n\nUK Drops Boris Johnson\u2019s Thursday Brexit Deadline, Talks Will Continue into November: Report https://t.co/FuKM1T3gNZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 14, 2020\n\nThe German leader\u2019s approach is in stark difference to that of France, which has vowed to show \u201cno weakness\u201d in negotiations, particularly in relation to fishing rights. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, the EU can plunder more than 60 per cent of the fish landed in the UK\u2019s territorial waters, with the French, for example, free to catch more than 90 per cent of English Channel cod.\n\nHowever, Mrs Merkel\u2019s tone also conflicts with statements just from Tuesday from Germany\u2019s own Europe minister. Michael Roth said that EU members \u201cexpect substantial progress by our friends in the United Kingdom in key areas: in particular on governance, \u2018level playing field\u2019 and fisheries\u201d \u2014 suggesting it should be Britain making all the compromises, not the EU.\n\nMr Roth has been clear that the EU should prepare for the UK\u2019s WTO exit. Likewise, Mrs Merkel has been consistent since the summer that both her country and the EU should prepare for the possibility of a no-deal scenario.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Johnson had made Thursday the deadline for either agreeing on a deal or deciding to walk away from negotiations and preparing for WTO, reports circulated on Wednesday that the prime minister was already preparing to extend that internal deadline further, after already reneging on a similar deadline he had set for June.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Barnier expressed what may be a generally felt assumption in Europe \u2014 that Johnson does not stick by his deadlines and may be a soft touch \u2014 saying: \u201cIt is the third unilateral deadline that Johnson has imposed without agreement\u2026 We still have time.\u201d\n\nOne government source told The Times that Brussels is using the \u201cold playbook\u201d of \u201crunning down the clock\u201d to put pressure on the UK.\n\nThe Telegraph reports, however, that Mr Johnson told ministers he still believes a deal can be struck by tomorrow, but said that there should be \u201cno fear\u201d over a no-deal Brexit.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tied Britain\u2019s post-Brexit success to the re-election of President Donald Trump, warning that should 77-year-old Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden prevail then the hopes of a British-American free trade deal would be dashed.\n\nThe long-time Trump ally said that the 2020 election is feeling like \u201c2016 all over again\u201d, pointing to polls produced by CNN and \u201cother anti-Trump media outlets\u201d showing a lead for the former vice president.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Express, Mr Farage referenced a poll conducted by the same British paper which saw the President leading in battleground states as an indicator that \u201conce again\u201d the mainstream media has got it wrong, quipping: \u201cYou might even call it Fake News.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in 2016, I stuck my neck out and not only backed the Trump campaign but also predicted he would win.

In the column, Mr Johnson said that the move by Obama to remove the bust of Sir Winston Churchill from the Oval Office was seen by some as a \u201csnub to Britain\u201d and a \u201csymbol of the part-Kenyan President\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British Empire.\u201d\n\nA British diplomat said: \u201cThey remember that. Democrats also regard Trump as appalling and disgusting and there will be a penalty for people who sucked up to Trump. Angela Merkel didn\u2019t. Macron did and then got tough. The Democrats don\u2019t much like Brexit.\u201d\n\nOther diplomats in America have sent back telegrams to the United Kingdom warning that a Biden administration would seek to secure a revival of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a deal with the EU rather than a bilateral agreement with Britain.\n\nMr Biden suggested in September that if the United Kingdom does not submit to European control over Northern Ireland then the U.S. would punish Britain, saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.\u201d\n\nBoris Suggest Anti-Brexit Biden Does Not Understand EU Talks https://t.co/fYpLrxs1NL \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 18, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulkaFormer British deputy prime minister of turned Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications at Facebook, Sir Nick Clegg, was allegedly involved in the tech giant\u2019s decision to censor the New York Post article exposing details about the Biden family.\n\nA report in The Telegraph claims that the anti-Trump British politician \u2014 who exited the former Conservative-Liberal Democrat government when the latter was trounced in the 2015 elections \u2014 was one of several members of the content moderation team who decided to reduce the distribution of the damaging report their site.\n\nWhile most censorship decisions on Facebook are handled by low-level employees and algorithms, high-profile cases such as the New York Post story are said to be handled by Facebook\u2019s vice president of content policy, then the vice president of global public policy, and, finally, by the former Lib Dem leader.\n\nA select few cases, including posts from President Donald Trump, are reportedly adjudicated by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, although the former deputy prime minister is also said to be in on such top decisions.\n\nSir Nick became Deputy Prime Minister in 2010 after forming a coalition government with the Conservative Party, then led by the notionally centre-right David Cameron.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Lib Dems saw a drastic decrease in support from the public, winning just 8 seats in the 2015 general election, a defeat which led to Sir Nick being ousted as leader of the party. In the 2017 snap election he lost his place in the British parliament entirely, with his constituents voting him out.\n\nSir Nick spent much of his enforced retirement trying to overturn the 2016 vote to Leave the European Union, but in 2018 he joined Facebook, writing in the left-wing Guardian that he was doing so to help the tech giant \u201cnavigate the numerous challenges it faces\u201d, including \u201cthe balance between free speech and prohibited content\u201d.\n\nWho Is Nick Clegg?

Senior Conservative MPs now argue that because the EU has negotiated in bad faith it is time to ditch the Withdrawal Agreement in a bid to ensure the UK is free from the threat of Brussels interference. The senior source said there were signs that EU leaders are so worried about the rise of populist leaders such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen that they have prioritised domestic politics over the need to agree a trade deal with Britain.\n\nFishing was a \u201chuge stumbling block\u201d in the talks which Downing St last week declared are now \u201cover\u201d and the EU is accused of not coming close to offering a deal comparable to the free trade agreement struck with Canada. The British team suspect the EU was \u201choping to \u2018bounce\u2019 us into accepting a legal text that they have prepared in isolation\u201d. The EU, the source added, \u201cseemed to think they could run down the clock to force the UK to make concessions that would fundamentally undermine our legal and economic autonomy. If they did think that, they have made a major misjudgment about this Government compared to its predecessors.\u201d The UK side feels the EU has \u201ctaken us for a ride and not taken the process seriously\u201d. Boris Johnson will not sit down for further talks unless there is the true prospect of a breakthrough.\n\nBoris Johnson and Michel Barnier are thrashing out Brexit as the days countdown\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe PM is focused on the Covid recovery effort and would not agree to join talks that waste time on process for the sake of it. The EU must fundamentally change course or the UK will leave in Australian-style terms, under which we will thrive.\u201d The door is not completely shut on a final-hour bid to nail down a deal, but Britain is clear what must happen for that to be possible. The source said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t continue with a negotiation that was more like performance art than real engagement. That is why we told [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier that there is no point in him coming to London this week unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU. \u201cMost observers would find it incredible at this point that thanks to EU manoeuvring there is literally no agreed treaty text of any kind in place. This must change. \u201cIf it does, we are always ready to listen.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister is focused on the UK's fight against Covid-19\n\nUnless EU leaders agree a bold change in strategy, the UK now faces the real prospect of the Brexit transition phase ending without a trade agreement in place. The source said: \u201cRegardless of the negotiations, at the end of the transition period the UK is leaving the single market and customs union, meaning that there will be significant changes at the border. The Government\u2019s view is that if the EU is unwilling to negotiate a trade deal with the UK before the end of the transition period, it may be several years before we can meaningfully return to the negotiating table.\u201d Senior Brexiteers are now pressing for the Government to pull out of the Withdrawal Agreement. Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u201c[We] have to recognise that the Withdrawal Agreement, and especially the Northern Ireland protocol, contain provisions that would allow the European Court of Justice to retain jurisdiction indefinitely in some cases and that would regulate our continuing relationship with the EU. There\u2019s a wide misconception that we can simply walk away from the negotiating table and then we get away on December 31 Scot-free and that is not the case because the Withdrawal Agreement prevails beyond the end of the transition period.\u201d\n\nArguing that the UK would be justified in ditching the agreement, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got good grounds to say that the EU itself has not performed its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement. [It says] the parties must use best endeavours and act in good faith to seek to secure a free trade agreement that is respectful of the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty and the integrity of the UK internal market. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly not done that... I think it\u2019s coming to the point where we have to make it very clear to the European Union they have not observed their obligations \u2013 their legal obligations \u2013 under the Withdrawal Agreement and that being the case the United Kingdom is perfectly entitled as a matter of law to take steps to protect its own national interest.\u201d Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u201cThere is no legal reason why we should be paying any money to the EU other than our budgetary contributions.\n\nIain Duncan-Smith said the UK shouldn't be paying any money to the EU\n\n\u201cIt is now clearer than ever that the EU did not conduct these negotiations in good faith. The Prime Minister should tear up the Withdrawal Agreement and not hand over a penny more than we owe.\u201d North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen, a leading Conservative Brexiteer, said: \u201cThe Withdrawal Agreement has got to go... If there\u2019s no trade deal we need to legislate to neutralise the Withdrawal Agreement as soon as we\u2019ve left in January [and] if we do have an agreement of any sort it needs to be stated in there that it fully replaces and supersedes the Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d A letter yesterday signed by pro-Brexit organisations including Alliance of British Entrepreneurs, Brexit Facts4EU, the Bruges Group, City for Britainand Scots for Leave urged the Prime Minister to \u201crepudiate the Withdrawal Agreement\u201d. It warned: \u201cAnything else would be a betrayal of democracy, sovereignty, and international law.\u201d\n\nAndrew Bridgen has called for the Withdrawal Agreement to be scrapped\n\nThe Centre for Brexit Policy this month warned that the Government\u2019s ambition of a Canadian-style deal is \u201call but unachievable\u201d if the Withdrawal Agreement remains in place. Marco Longhi, the Conservative Dudley North MP, argues Brussels is intent on \u201cmaking an example of what happens to a member state that refuses to play any longer\u201d but says the future of the EU is now in danger. The MP, who grew up in Rome, argues that euroscepticism may intensify in Italy. He said: \u201cIn Italy there is growing disapproval of the EU; in a recent survey 42 percent of respondents said they would leave the EU, up from 26 percent in 2018... As euroscepticism builds across Europe, nation-states such as Italy should not fear the prospect of opening to the global economy.\n\nEuroscepticism could be growing in ItalyBBC Countryfile presenter Ellie Harrison has insisted that \u201cthe countryside is racist\u201d after the BBC courted controversy by reporting that many minorities see it as a \u201cwhite environment\u201d.\n\nWriting in the magazine associated with the BBC mainstay, which debuted on television over thirty years ago, Harrison said: \u201cIn asking whether the countryside is racist, then yes it is; but asking if it\u2019s more racist than anywhere else \u2014 maybe, maybe not.\u201d\n\nShe had been responding to a controversy involving BBC coverage of a government report on the supposed exclusion of minorities from the countryside, fronted by fellow presenter Dwayne Fields.\n\nThe broadcaster drew the ire of many on social media when it stated that \u201cmany in Black, Asian and minority ethnic [BAME] groups see the countryside as being a white environment\u201d on Twitter.\n\n\u201c[J]udging by the thousands of angry responses to the BBC\u2019s race-baiting tweet, there are a lot of people in Britain \u2013 both white and non-white \u2013 who object very strongly to having the natural landscape used by the BBC as a political football to advance its woke agenda,\u201d reported Breitbart columnist James Delingpole at the time.\n\nWhile @DwayneFields found solace in the landscapes of the UK and beyond, many in Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups see the countryside as being a white environment #countryfile pic.twitter.com/kjma7FuGps \u2014 BBC Countryfile (@BBCCountryfile) June 28, 2020\n\n\u201cI spooled through the comments, which broadly came in three flavours: \u2018I\u2019m not racist so there is no racism in the countryside\u2019; \u2018I\u2019m black and I\u2019ve never experienced racism in the countryside\u2019; and importantly, \u2018I have experienced racism in the countryside\u2019,\u201d Harrison said of the controversy.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s work to do. Even a single racist event means there is work to do.\u201d\n\nThe 42-year-old went on to issue something of a self-denunciation for her failure to be sufficiently strident in her anti-racism prior to the Black Lives Matter unrest, saying: \u201cUntil this point, I believed ignorantly, that me being not racist was enough. I believed that I should keep quiet and listen to black people.\u201d\n\nNow, however, she says she understands \u201cThere is a big and crucial difference between being not racist and being anti-racist\u2026 being anti-racist means being much clearer that it isn\u2019t acceptable\u2026 Let the knife and fork squeak uncomfortably over supper.\u201d\n\nThe idea that minorities are somehow persecuted when they attempt to enjoy the outdoors is also being pushed by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which runs the mega-globalist Davos summit each year.\n\nThis Black British hiker is tackling exclusion from the outdoors https://t.co/1x7P6ch8FZ pic.twitter.com/I4J31CiVkf \u2014 World Economic Forum (@wef) October 6, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery"
